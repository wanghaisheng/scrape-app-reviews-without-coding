"So, I’m a very beginner editor and was happy to come across capcut seeing as that it was free and had great reviews. I have almost mastered this app completely and don’t want to leave and switch over to something that’s paid when capcut is doing things that every other editing service is doing. However, there is always room to grow, especially for the editors who’s skills are growing faster and wanting more. A few of my recommendations is having more advanced and better options for speed. Please add more filters (specifically in the border area), and add ones that are different and will give our videos good quality(I’m pretty sure y’all can come up with something!). I ask that we get more font options and allow us to use more than 1 animation for out fonts PLEASEE!! Those are just a few of my recommendations. Now, on to my concerns the app does lag a little, and constantly says that I’m out of storage and I delete a lot of previous edits just to make new ones, and I’m getting concerned that the app will just not be enough for me. It’s already taken up most of my storage andI really want it to be worth it, but all these glitches, lags, and thirst for storage is not going to make using this app worth it. I hope someone sees this, and I hope you have a great rest of your day/night."
"I love capcut! I appreciate how everything is free and how you can remove the watermark at the end. I have been using this app for like a year now and i think its great and easy to use. i do have some recommendations though because i do find some little issues or something i would like to be better/fixed. so my first recommendation is that you guys should maybe add more animations to both, texts and clips. for the texts, i think itd be cool to have more varieties to choose from. i know there's a lot of choices already but i mean that maybe if possible, there could be combos like there is for clips. i think itd look great on edits and would be very useful. and now for clips, i think if you could add more ins and out transitions, it would be fun to be able to have more transitions. maybe you could even add more combos as well. id also think a new great addition would be if there were to be more shakes and stuff. I dont think theres many shakes to add to your edits so i think more would be cool. another suggestion is to make the speed adjusts cleaner. sometimes when i make it slower, it looks blury or just doesnt look like it has the same quality as it would with normal speed. i do hsve more recommendations id like to share but i dont really know exactly how to explain it but if you could add/fix those things, i think the app would be 5x better! :)"
"Sadly, I can’t do animation, like how I do it in KineMaster, but this is still AMAZING. the stickers are beyond adorable (some are like- uhm y’know that kind of EdGy but anyways-) it’s a great app. It’s actually a step up from KineMaster, which I did not expect. I’m so happy we are able to delete the watermark at the end, it’s just great. And everything is free! it’s awesome and it’s pretty much everything you need (sadly no animation key thing.) the chroma key is SOO good. I can remove part of my green/pink screen in the background  without any pink/green thing on my character or art disappearing! The effects are really nice and aesthetic, and some are just really cool. (some are kinda uhm weird imo) the effects are perfect for edits, the retro or vintage ones have to be my favorite! Also the in and out animations are cool, and there are some that are for the whole duration of the video/photo, which is cool. The customization abilities for the text are great. You can give the text a font, color, some special design (example: making it glow) in and out transitions, animations that last for the duration the text is on the screen, and you can put it in a text box or something, and there are some really cute ones! There is so much I haven’t explored yet,  and I know it’ll probably be good. I recommend this app for beginners, pros, anyone really. 5 stars, 10/10 I love the app

Sincerely,
-a person"
"First of all, I love this app so much, so in now way or form is this hate. I’d like to state some of my suggestions to improve CapCut! So the first suggestion I was thinking of is a feature where you can add graphs to you keyframes to make them look smoother. Another suggestion I have is more fonts. I do love some of the fonts you’ve provided us with, but I would love if there was a way we could upload our own fonts into the app. I’ve been thinking about this next suggestion for quite some time now, and I think it would be really effective and really improve this app! Maybe you could add a feature where we can make our own transitions? Now, I realize this might be a stretch, but hear me out: if we could make our own transitions, it would really increase our creativity skills. I know that other apps already have this feature, but I feel like CapCut is better, considering it’s 100% free! Oh! One more thing I’d like to mention. I was thinking you could add more mask shapes? Like maybe a feature where we could mask our own shapes? Ooh and maybe we could mask our clip and you could add a feature where we can have a glow effect around the masked area? Idk, it was just a thought. Well I hope you take some of these into consideration. Have a nice day!"
"I would love a more in depth audio editing interface, with mixers for the different layers that indicate the sound levels. I’d also love the ability to use an equalizer on any audio track individually along with audio filters (Having to extract audio from a video in order to add voice effects doesn’t count). This, along with the ability to change more render settings would be great. For example, changing the bitrate for the entirety of the video could be simplified using a slider that goes from “smaller size, lower quality” to “larger size, higher quality.” The ability to render in the background would also be a much appreciated feature as a lot of us who use CapCut to edit do so on our main device that we need to access, and on larger projects it’s impossible to get a render done. Even older devices are capable of background rendering. I’m sure many people would be willing to wait for a slightly longer render in favor of being able to use their phone or tablet whilst the render is being completed. (An indicator can be used to signal whether the render is ongoing, has failed, or has finished). One last thing. Im sure many would enjoy a precision movement tool that allowed for things like key framing to be more precise when changing the size of location of a clip."
"This is a short review bc in too lazy but the app is basically useless for me if i can’t even add a video edit a video. I’m saying this bc every time I open the app and click add it says my storage is full😐 I am mad bc i delete and delete things but it says the same thing i power off my phone but it still says that and I can’t even edit. But other than that, it’s a pretty good app u can remove the watermark FOR FREE and most editing apps make you pay. It has decent effects filters etc. overlays are good and trimming is very easy for people that just started. I think it’s a great app for first timers it’s easy to use it’s not updated very much just bug fixes and a few new effects but everything is alright. It’s easy to add your own watermark too and many choices, you can make it look like vs which is cool and useful for those who get bullied for using CapCut. Speed and velocity are something that need a bit more work I say it’s not very smooth kinda laggy too,also we need more effects don’t get me wrong the ones we have are GREAT but I feel like they’re getting… old. It’s also good it’s not all presets unlike many other apps. But yeah my honest opinion about this is good"
"Hello capcut team. I've made 3 reviews or more on this app, and all of them were weird..and childish. I've matured over the days, weeks, months, & years. And here's my final (?) review I hope not to change because of accidents or just, childishness. This app is overall good. Sadly, there aren't any effects I'd hope to find. But this is the most easiest app for editing I've seen. So, that's fine. Most of the transitions are good, some are meh…But it's fine if you don't mind that, and besides kinemaster it's so easy to use! The exporting is way faster than kinemaster's. if you make a 2 minute video, it's done quickly. But not in 10 seconds you actually need to wait. But for kinemaster? Pfft. Don’t even get me started! But, there is something that bothers me. The zooming in. Kinemaster's zooming is just amazing! You can do memes with it and a bunch of other stuff(Zooming in for animations, gacha life, gacha club, etc.) But capcut's zooming kinda annoys me all the time I use it. I use the key (I forgot what it's called, sorry.) thing to zoom in, but it turns out horrible. And, yes. Effects have zooming in, but those bother me too! That's the only issue I have. Buts that's all! Goodbye capcut team, Keep up the good work."
I know that some of y’all are great editors out there but I’m gonna give y’all some more things that you should probably do a .CapCut one of the first things that you should do is you should look at all the edit editing that people have been doing on there and you look at your edits from back then on your other app that you’ve been using this is completely free app you don’t need any of your money to pay for it these these are facts that are on here are really good they they have a good quality they just look good overall add a lot a lot of affects to one of your pictures or videos and one of the things that I just wanna put out there is that some of y’all are pros at this and some of y’all are not processes but that’s OK because anybody doesn’t have to be pressed to have a good editing a edit sorry no editing and if you don’t think your edit is good go back and look through and just look through the edit that you did if you don’t look through the edit that you did it’s fine because you can try affects you can try writing on it you can try doing a lot of stuff on it there’s a lot more stuff than it looks like love CapCut.
"I think that the app is amazing I use it on all of my TikTok videos but one very minor criticism of the app I have is that if maybe I delete some thing but i maybe deleted the wrong thing or I have a good idea that I want to put into the video I just made but because I deleted the original draft on CapCut because I was going to post a TikTok for example I won’t be able to go back and get the original draft from CapCut if I deleted it. So what I’m trying to say is I think that there should be a temporary trash pile section so that just in case somebody deleted the wrong thing or they want to edit it but didn’t expect to, they don’t have to worry about redoing everything they just did they can just go back to the original thing and recover it and just add in or take out whatever it is they were going to do. The trash pile would be the best thing that you could add to the app right now that’s the only reason I’ve given a four star review if I could’ve given a four and a half I would but it doesn’t work that way with the ratings so it really is a very minor thing but it can be quite annoying otherwise please consider it it’s very simple"
"I make a lot of edits and capcut is great, I love the new updates lately. I do have a suggestion though,  maybe y’all could make folders for us to organize and sort out edits. I have a problem with organizing things and it would be really nice to have folders. Anyways overall this is a great app once you get the hang of it your edits will look great :) - tips - If your trying to get better quality use the effect “sharpen” you’ll have to adjust the settings of it to where the red and blue colors line up behind the black line - If your trying to make a velocity edit go to “style” dont split your clip at the beats all you have to do is wait for it to load and once it’s applied change the speed for the velocity to match the beat - To get a small flicker effect go to “text” and put “.” then change the color to white and adjust the size of it to where it’s covering the entire screen then change The opacity to 3 then go to “animation” go to ”loop” scroll over till you find “random flash” then adjust the speed as fast as it will go then click off and put it on the entire video - alright I’m done here have fun editing :)"
"So CapCut is a really great app. It has really all of the most advanced features that you couldn’t find in any other video editing app. I have seen that ads for these on Instagram and it turns out that they were not lying about these features. This is basically the sole reason why I am writing this review. I don’t even know why this app has a rating of only 4.5. It should be at least 4.8. But just like any other video editing app (I should be sorry to say this lol) it has it’s flaws. I want more filters, like an invert filter. Also some people may not understand English so it may be a problem for them if they want a video editing app that could feature their language. That also applies to the effects, filters, etc. So please, allow users to select their own language. It could also be good if you could put a dark mode, be able to save your music, or SFX to the app, and name your video before you start your project. This is all I have to say. Hopefully CapCut listens to my review, so that all users of this app could get a comfortable video editing experience."
"I got to say CapCut is one of the best apps out there!! It’s 100% free, and it has amazing features! I use it all the time to make random edits or Roblox edits. It makes edits so interesting and fun to do! I definitely think there could be some improvements but then again no app is perfect, but I do have some suggestions you should take into consideration: first add more voice affects, I love this feature and it makes you voice really cool but I think it would help to add more of a variety. Next I think you should improve the volume. I like that you can change the volume but it only turns up or down so much so I think you should change that. And another one is to add more fonts I absolutely love the fonts CapCut provides but I definitely think we should be able to choose our own fonts or you could add some more. Those are just a few suggestions but over all CapCut is an amazing app that I highly recommend whoever made this app is so talented and needs a lot of credit! I think there could be a few improvements but all in all it’s definitely a great and fantastic app that makes editing easy and fun!!!"
"I really like this app, it doesn’t crash like my other editing software, the transitions are amazing, the effects are out of this world, and the text customization is one I’ve never seen before on mobile Editing. I just wanted to suggest that you guys that run this app give more creative control over the effects, for example letting us fade them in and fade out, how fast or slow we want the effects. I also wanted to suggest and ask if you guys could put in an option where we just switch are clips from video to overlay and also the ability to lock/pin our overlays. Also, an option where we can automatically resize our video to full screen because since there’s not an option to it may not go 100% back to the full screen. Last thing I’d like to request is if you guys could put an option where we can unlink the audio from the video two adjusted and move around as necessary. Again this app is superb and I just think these suggestions that I’ve provided would help a lot of others editing experience on this app. Thank you for your time."
"Don’t get me wrong, this app is great! It is 100% free, NO watermark, and has some really good features! It built-in stickers and filters that are well and good. Also, did I mention, IT HAS MULTIPLE LAYERS!! That’s friekin incredible!! I tested and it has up to five other layers of video or photo! This is one of the only apps on mobile that actually has multiple layers and is free!
Onto the not so good things...It has most of the basic features you need EXCEPT good Volume, the volume feature is really bad, you can barely turn the volume down it only sounds SLIGHTLY quieter when you’re almost all the way at the “0” volume thing. Also, in my opinion there should be more options for volume customization maybe such as “audio stabilization” or something like that. Also the slow-down effects and the voice effects could use work. It has some really useful filters with camcorder and 90’s effects built into the app which is really cool. The transitions are actually surprisingly un-cheesy. I wanted to say thank you to the person who made this app! It is a really good app and definitely could use some changes but overall It’s really great!"
"I love this app! I recommend it for Gachatubers, editors, photos, aesthetic videos, YouTubers…etc. The point is: It’s a great app that is not super complicated to use. Obviously you can make it complicated if you’re more advanced (something I am not), but it’s an amazing app! The only somewhat big problem I have is that it can be slow. Usually when I add many videos/photos it starts to not download stuff into the camera roll. But that’s it and I’ve only recently have trouble when I make big projects! Thank you to the CapCut team! Keep up the good work! Edit: Hi! So it has been a LONG time of me using it- Ok not that long. Like a year or something. But anyways, it’s a great app still. The thing is it takes up SO much storage. Like I’m almost out of storage on my phone 😭 I don’t know how apps are made, but I know they all have to have certain things. If there is a way that the storage concern could be taken care of it would be greatly appreciated. 😁 I still recommend downloading this app, but be careful of the storage issue. Watch some videos to know what could cause the storage to go up to limit doing certain things!"
"I can’t believe this app is still FREE! This is  the best editing app I have, it’s literally my life! Everything is so easy to figure out, and there’s so many things to do! It never crashes, the transitions are beautiful, there is a very wide variety of effects and so much more. First off, the transitions. They are so great, and there is so many types of them! You can keep it plain or change it up with some effects in the transition! Next, the effects. They’re so amazing, and there is so many to choose from. There are categories like bling, party, shadow, comic and more! You can also add texts to your video. You can choose how long the text stays on screen, choose from a big selection of fonts, colors and effects to your text! Again, everything is so easy to do and very easy to figure out. I use this so much for so many kinds of edits. My favorite part about this is that you can add audio. You can choose from a lot of different default sounds, extract audio from video clips, and trim the sound! CapCut is amazing, and if you’re looking for an editing app I definitely suggest this!"
"Capcut offers so many different effects and filters to choose from. It is a free app with no adds. CapCut is great for starters or even pros! It gives you the awesome experience of a true editor, it’s highly recommended.    Will you be the next to download?

Dear owner of CapCut,
I would like to tell you an idea that I have for a effect. So the effect would basically be like a zooming in effect. There will be 5-20 pictures on a screen that the editor will pick the background color of. They can pick 5-20 photos out of their albums and then place them on the screen. They will look like little pictures that you would take out of a polaroid camera. Then once their music hits the beat drop then the zoom comes in. It will automatically zoom in to a random photo that the editor has chosen. Then their will be some shakes or  other effects that will be given to make the edit look good. And the. It will zoom out of the picture and then zoom into another. This will happen 2-3 times. And yeah, that’s my idea thanks for your time!"
"When I heard about CapCut, I was so amazed by it I wanted to download it right away. And when I did, it was amazing! It has great features, such as animations, stickers, and even adding your own fonts from downloaded files! And I’m in love with the new graph setting for key points! Except, that’s what has been glitching lately. I was working on an edit when I needed to use key points for an overlay. I made the key points, no problems yet, until I added the graphs. When I selected one, the second key point reset all the adjustments I made to the overlay. The chroma key and movements went back to its original state. The first key point remained the same though. At first I thought it was only a minor glitch, but when I clicked undo and tried again, the same thing happened. I tried undoing the key point, adding the overlay again, I even exported the edit and made a new project to try again, but nothing worked. CapCut has lagged in the past, but that’s only because there were a ton of effects or overlays. This is a real problem. Overall, great app, but frustrating glitches."
So I download capcutToday and there’s no problem with this so far but I just wish that you could be able to search up the music because I feel like some of the songs on there aren’t what I’m looking for for the video that I making for Tiktok or for YouTubeAnd I don’t really like switching through other apps to add the certain type of music that I want or just have to go and TikTok and screen record and then like at the music from the video so I just wish that you could make an option where you can search up whatever song that she whines that I have an added on other platforms and even though you can do Apple Music I don’t have Apple Music so I just feel like that you should have the option to be able to search up the song instead of having to pick whatever songs are on there even though don’t give me wrong the songs are not bad they are very good but I just wish that I could listen to some songs with lyrics and something that is more me so I hope you see this and I hope I enjoy this app even more.
"I think this is a great app, it’s really fun with all the things that it has. I just think that it’s just a really great editing app 100% free for all the effects & watermark and I also have a few suggestions which is that maybe you could try to add different languages for people that don’t speak or understand English, yet I don’t know if your working on that feature and I think would you maybe add some more option to have like a in & out & combo together for the I really forgot the name - but I think you could maybe add some more options for the texts like maybe a out animation and combos, again I don’t know if this is already a feature, but I’ve seen adds for the app and they don’t lie about the features and things and I think it’s really cool how you can change the speed of the video in your own way and how the app has so maybe features. I just think it’s also really easy to use and understand how to use the app so I suggest some of the things I listed to be addded to the app thank you for reading!. - .Afton Fan."
"OK, so first of all, it works beautifully! I dislike the fact that sometimes it kicks you out of the app but that might just be my phone. Also with all the people saying that you can't upload videos over fifteen minutes long, have you ever heard of ""Video merging""??? Also I found that if there is something like a background or something like that you can use iMovie for an easier upload (Might just be me but it kept crashing). I also use iMovie for videos over fifteen minutes long so they can be, over fifteen minutes long (XD). But I do have a suggestion with the app creators:

Could you please put in an option to start a template without having a video? It would be a lot easier to record straight from the app then having to do the process of recording, then uploading, then cropping everything and all that jazz. It's just so much easier to record straight from the app! But in total, if it wasn't for the recording thing I give it a solid 4/5 stars. 

(By the way if a developer reads this and puts in thanks so much!)"
"CapCut is an AMAZING editing app for new beginner editors, people don’t see it as an editing app but it is when you get to see more of the like transitions, effects etc. there’s so many things you can do with this app though there are presets you can use those presets and combine them with other presets. 

Now my suggestions. I think if there were graphs and making your own transitions would be AMAZING, maybe if there were also motion blur in effects or like mirror like titles in alight motion it would be great and maybe even pass alight motion, and lastly maybe you could add like titles for your project incase you are deleting projects (for storage) so you don’t delete something you don’t want to delete.

 This app is already amazing so if you’re a beginner editor you should use CapCut it’s amazing it has great transitions, effects etc more things than alight motion has but alight motion is still advance with the graphs etc. So you should start with CapCut honestly before using any other big editing apps like alight motion or AE."
"CapCut is great, but there are some down hills on it, so CapCut i'd  appreciate if you'd read this and take in some suggestions of what to add to your app. not only will these suggestions hopefully boost your ratings and downloads but could also help the improvement of editing and of course better quality! 1: smoother slow-mo. i will admit the slow-mo is pretty bad. its laggy and just not very good. 2: graphs, OMG i swear CapCut, graphs would be SOO helpful! not only for premade animations but for keyframes and overlays! it would help make animation smoother and fit with the kind of theme people are trying to do, and over all easier. 3: this one isnt very important, but being able to add overlays more than once at a time. if someone is planning on adding quite a few overlays to their videos its frustrating having to add them one at a time. 4: the abilty to add splice to text without having to make a video and overlay to your other one!
 
anyways these were just suggestions, but i do know many people agree with me so CapCut, please add these things! minus that this app is really good!"
"this app is really cool! It has like things I can do whenever I’m bored sometimes, it’s okay just I think one part that gets me questioning myself is the part where every time I like add animations for each video then add to the others I go back to the start of the edit and see the animation doesn’t play so I usually repeat it but that’s okay! Just questioned myself about that nothing wrong, and I also love it how when you add auto captions like say for example you add a video with muffled words and you don’t understand a little so you add the auto caption it’s like this whole or the whole system just has like big ears or something cause it’s like awesome. To me it’s like really extraordinary because I have never done this before and now I started to use this app it’s like really different for me, because I used to be a lazy person and just use templates but when really I wanted to do more like experience more so when I did that I just couldn’t believe it, it was just amazing 🤩 💖💪😎 (and yes I am 7 and kid so I wrote this)"
Love app but I have a few suggestions first the slow speed   try to make it look good it’s glitchy and overall I don’t like it second better quality to make edit look nice and clean like if it were a edit of a person make good quality so it doesn’t look like it is blurry 3rd of all the affects some things you can add is different blurry into focus and when it is blurry maybe make it look cool like add shapes 4th add a update where it flashes on the beat or color 5th suggestion the transitions make good looking ones that are smooth6th maybe there gonna be an option where you can select certain parts of the edit such as if you were doing a edit of a person you can select a place where are you either want to flash black or white or rainbow6th all the fonts on the app don’t look nice maybe have nice looking ones that will make edits look different fonts would be nice. Hope you take my suggestions into consideration love the app and hope to see more updates
Okay to be honest (tbh) this is the best app I have on my phone rn so I recommend it and here are reasons why to download it just in case you don’t know for sure.1# you can learn how to use all the tools in one minute okay so when I first got this app I edited Rick Astley never gonna give you up and I learned the tools in one minute but it felt like 1 second and I still have it today 😂 2# no offense Kinemaster but this is better than KineMaster but this is my opinion if you use kinemaster and like it better than it’s okay  3# If your a beginner than this app is for you   And that’s all know I have some suggestions idk if you have this one because I been using this app for 10 months but can we add a loop like on you have a video and they restart it without you knowing and if you have it then please tell me how idk if you do so that’s just a suggestion ty for reading this review pls put my suggestion in the game ty so much making a app that beginners  pros  hackers can use ty                From : Jupiter
"So if you’ve seen the ads for this app, you’re probably like “they’re just saying that, it’s not that easy” but no, it really is! CapCut is definitely the easiest editing software I’ve used and you probably don’t need a tutorial for how to use it because of how simple it is! In just a few minutes you’ll be making unbelievable edits you didn’t think you could make, it’s really just the best app for editing if you’re just starting out, looking for something simpler, or anything else!
Of course it has its flaws, like when you’re selecting an animation it’ll lag a bit until you select the animation which is a little annoying because if you don’t like it you have to deselect the animation tool, but doesn’t really affect the quality or anything, and sometimes it’s hard to time things right when it tries to put it in place for you, but overall just an amazing app!
I’ve made such amazing edits with this app, I can’t believe how well they turned out and how easy it was to make them."
I download this app with my friend told me that it was great editing out for my channel when I first download the app I loved it so much I started immediately working on the intro for my channel but I had started to have some problems and it was my bedtime so I went to bed in the next morning it wasn’t letting me go into it wasn’t letting me go into what I was editing so I deleted many of my apps so I could continue using this one app because it said not enough storage and I wasted so many apps for it to not even let me in so I think it’s like a bug or some thing I think you guys should make it so some people look at it can get in I don’t know if this is like for everyone it’s just me and I don’t know if it’s on my end or your end so if it’s on my end please let me know also when I deleted the app to see if I could re-open the app and I could use it again to continue to start over with the editing it wouldn’t let me download it I’m pretty sure that part is on my end but I just wanted to say it that game is really really good though it’s not a game it’s an editing app but I love it so much
First of all the app is wonderful for editing stuff you can do so many things with it and you can upload it to TikTok so anything you create you can post on TickTock which I find amazing and helpful. But the first thing I would have to suggest is an eraser because every time I go on TickTock and like screenshot or something or some thing is in the way and then I can’t use it because there isn’t an eraser and then every time I go on different apps to see if they have an a racer they do but it’s only if you pay like $30 a month and I’m not gonna do that that’s way too expensive just for me to use an eraser. So please add an eraser and the second thing I want to add is please try to add some handmade videos like you could add like aesthetic clips or like some Gothic clips or like some stuff to make your stuff look a little bit better you don’t have to I know it takes a long time for you to read some suggestions and do it but for future notice please try to think about these suggestions
"It’s an OK app and for video editing it’s pretty reliable but if you try and use their templates they tend to get corrupted and turn black and stop working also if you try and select photos after you select one it will take you back to the top and if you’ve selected a certain folder it’ll take you out of that folder but it doesn’t do that with videos. So adding videos to edit is really easy but if you want to add photos it’s going to take a lot of time or you need to go into your Photos app and favorite all of them first and then try and open them one by one from the favorite album but it still sends you to the top after each selection so it’s very tedious and time-consuming. I originally used InShot for all my video editing and then switched over to CapCut after learning about it on Tiktok but I think I’ll switch back to InShot now. Essentially they feel like they do the same things but InShot never fails me or glitches while CapCut glitches often.
Also I’ve never had an issue saving a large file from InShot but I have had several issues saving large files from CapCut."
"Ok, I gotta say even tho I’m 11 I have never found any other better editing app than CapCut. It’s so good in so many ways. Like you could go to any other editing app and it would have a watermark and it would make you pay for extra transitions, filters, etc, and you could just say it wasn’t even that good. CapCut however, haha I cant even explain how helpful it has been! I suppose one thing I could suggest is making more of like you know transitions like shaking ones and bouncing ones because personally I use this app to edit my roblox tiktoks. Otherwise it has so many different things to choose from like filters, texts, you can even crop the video size! How amazing now I don’t even need my other apps because I have an iPhone 6. It also allows you to save videos up to however long which is so useful because I used another app and you couldn’t even save it if it was over 15 or 30 seconds! Can you believe that?!? Anyways thank you so much CapCut this app is amazing!! <3"
"This app is amazing. But the actual app size changed my phone. Storage on my phone was so bad I had to delete it and now my storage is way better. Although this app is absolutely amazing and helps me edit my other things, I do think the sizing is a little bit too much. I’m not a good expert at knowing how to change things, but if it could be changed I would like the app size to be a little different. This is pretty cool but I never knew how to use the green screen also. I never saw it anywhere but I’ve seen so many people use the green screen effect on cap cut. If that could be changed everything would be awesome because I’ve been looking for the green screen button for so long. I’ve been using this app for months now and I do think that I’m getting the hang of it. It is a little confusing which I wish that could change but I mean, it’s an editing app it takes practice. Anyways overall the only reason why I think it’s a three is because it is a little confusing to do and the size is really bad. But I do think this app is very helpful."
"Im giving this app a 5 star i  didnt checked the app out at first i was just scamming though it , it have everything i was looking for in one . All the other apps  had only one particular thing i was looking for and then i had to download more & more apps just to make make my videos complete and successful , but this app it have everything in one . I havent made a full video yet but for all the people that says the app cant go over 15mins , not calling you out or anything but if you think wisely and smart you would come up with a thing “make the video til were it stops , then create a whole nother video were you left off , then add them both together.” I havent tried this idea on my own yet but i have a little faith that its gonna work because they literally blessed me with this app and it dont have “capcut” on the side of it to let people know what you edit your videos with . I dont know about the other people having problems with it but me myself is A-ok! 🙃💕💕."
"Ive been using capcut for most of my content on tiktok, its an amazing app to use, its free, convenient, has no ads, and its not so complicated to use. Theres only one big issue at the moment. I have no idea if people are going through this or its just me but ive been experiencing some glitches related to the app. When i try to zoom in, it’ll constantly reset from where I previously was, and when i try cropping it to another place on my video or photo it’ll do the exact same thing. Ive also tried putting video over another to add effects to my video, but the video seems invisible for some reason, and instead of playing the video without sound when scrolling through the bar, it’ll just cut into frames and make it impossible for me to time things correctly. Again, i have no idea if other users are facing this but please i beg you to fix this. Its starting to turn my 1-2 hours pf editing to 3-4, its driving me NUTS; but overall i really enjoy using this app!"
"So I like this app and have no problem in it. I recommend this app for content creators. And it has the features that make my videos twice as more entertaining. And I recommend this app because it’s better than kienmaster and other editing app I’ve used and less complex. Although, there are two issues, when I often export my videos, (reminder that this happened yesterday and today) I wait so long for it to finally export just to have the exporting process fail. Not only the slow exporting is an issue but it says that my storage is too much and I thought my storage was the case. And I started deleting unwanted apps to save storage to only experience the same issue AGAIN. I have has less GB of storage yet it asks me to try again or whatever. All I know is that this issue never seemed to happen to me when I used the app the day before yesterday please fix the exporting issue. I would rate it 5/5 if you could. And if it’s not CapCut or my GB of storage, let me know."
"So I’ve used CapCut since 2020, and I’ve always loved it.  One thing is the slow mo, especially when trying to edit an animation. It could be smoother, but that’s not something that makes the app horrible. Actually, nothing about the app is bad! But I have two recommendations for it. Could you add a twixor like affect? It may be difficult, but that would make the app much better. One more thing, I don’t think you know this but, if I use copyright © audio, you won’t get the fine, so I think you should add “ good “ audios because these ones are just non copyrighted material. You could at-least add anime or Japanese songs, but I’m not complaining, because I usually just use extracted.  Also, can you make it so I can edit how much I use the voice affect? I would like to make two voices go together for something, but the deep voice affect is too much, so could you let us adjust how much we use thee?
Besides my greedy recommendations, this app is lovely!"
"So this is an amazing app! It has great transitions animations and filters, and i LOVE how there is no watermark! But some things are messing up.

	Once i was making an edit and when it has the finishing CapCut watermark clip, i added a heart where it says to add a text. Now, i started making an edit and the heart text wont go away. (The two edits are completely different.) Now when i try to play my edit, there is a <3 in the middle of my clips. I cant make it go away and i have no idea whats happening. I even tried to change the text but thats not working either, the heart is permanent. Thats the only downside about mine.

	But, you know after effects right? Well, I’m on a mobile device so i dont have after effects. But, when you add key frames on after effects, you can do a graph as-well the graphs make the key frame animations much much smoother. (I know this by watching ae/after effects edits). Is it possible if CapCut can do the graph aswell? Its ok if its not possible. Thank you!"
"When I first started video editing, this was the second app I stumbled across, and I haven’t switched since. I almost immediately understood the controls and began making edits. The effects are all amazing, (shakes, transitions, video effects,  animations, etc.) but could be more advanced. While you can export a video after having used one animation then add another in a different project, that is extremely tedious. All I’m asking for is smoother, more professional looking animations (mainly shake animations that don’t look choppy 😭) Still, I have nothing against this app and highly recommend it. The only problem I’ve had is with the smooth slow motion effect making weird, green frames within the video clip your trying to apply the effect to. Otherwise, everything works amazingly. It always blows me away to see what people can create in this app, and what continues to be added. I won’t switch editing softwares for a LONG time. ❤️"
"First let me clear this up. I’ve seen a lot of reviews saying “CapCut supports the Ukrainian and Russian war because they took away CapCut in Ukrainian!!!!!” Well how do you know the owner supports it?!?! You have to consider stuff. Like how would they be able to use the app right now anyway they are in the middle of war!  
And also what if there’s a bug or something in Ukrainian and they can’t use the app. Second I’ve seen a lot of things saying “it’s not synced” or what so ever but this is not a put in a photo and be done with it app though it’s very easy to use. It’s a great app and one of the best and easiest editing apps I’ve seen. It’s free though there is a premium. But you can use it without the premium! I definitely recommend this app! If you just get it and need help, there’s loads of tutorials out there to help you! This is a great app! Thank you for reading this, I hope it helps! Have a great day/night! Bye!"
"Honestly, I love CapCut. It is so simple and easy to use. I don’t have to pay for anything. Although, I have seem some problems lately. First of all, we do not need this many fonts. Half the time some of them don’t even work. If you’re going to continue to add more, please add a “favorites” section for the text. It would be really useful because I only have two major fonts I use so scrolling through, trying to find them, gets annoying. Also, if I am working on a edit and I mute the sound for The whole thing, I USED to be able to change the volume on other clips. For some reason I can’t do that know? It’s really annoying having to go through ALL the clips and mute them just because I needed one to have sound. It would be really nice if you could stop adding so many texts and features to the app. It’s supposed to be simple and the more and more stuff you add, the more complicated it will become. I really do love this app, but it does need some changes."
"First of all, CapCut is a great app for beginners and it’s easy once you get used to it though I’ve been using CapCut for a while and I can’t help but want more. Also there is a problem with the storage, if you make a video on CapCut and save it, you can find out that CapCut itself actually is the cause of full storage, not the video itself, but I have found some solutions, use less effects and add ones so you can have less storage it’ll take, but if you really wanna use a lot, delete it off CapCut after saving it so you can only access it in your video album, this prevents most to all the storage that one video will take up, but the problem with that is, if you notice a mistake while watching it, you can’t go back. It’s not easy to edit on top of it so you’ll have to live with it. I get annoyed by this but I need to save storage to make more videos. I hope you understand. Pls fix it.🌼🌸🌵"
"I absolutely love CapCut to death, it’s my favorite editing app thus far. It gives me so many tools and edits smoothly and with ease. I do want to say however, whenever I try to export some videos in full 4K quality and 60 FPS, it crashes at 70% or 80% of exportation (I have an iPhone 13 so I don’t think it’d be processing on my end) is there any way y’all can fix this? It would be so very appreciated, because I really want to export some of my projects in lossless quality. Whenever it does export, CapCut makes it look so pristine and smooth, so of course I’d want most of my videos to export as such! A suggestion I’d love to see added into the app is effects being able to fade in and out, a lot of the effects have harsh cuts and I usually can only attach it to a frame to make it seem-less, I’d love to see the team add fading options in and out for the overlay effects that they give us. Overall I love the app, keep doing your thang!"
"so capcut is an amazing app, the only thing i really have wrong with it is that it needs a bit more features but my problem is probably gonna be solved in no time because recently capcut has been adding a lot of updates! keep ‘em coming cause this may be better than after effects soon! now the best thing that i 𝐋𝐎𝐕𝐄 about this app is that it’s so easy! i remember when i first downloaded this app i was hoping it’s easy because i’ve downloaded SO MANY editing apps but deleted them all because of how hard it is, stuff like : kinemaster, after effects, and more but when i first downloaded this and did my first edit it was 𝐒𝐎 𝐄𝐀𝐒𝐘, 𝐒𝐎 𝐒𝐌𝐎𝐎𝐓𝐇, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐒𝐎 𝐆𝐑𝐄𝐀𝐓. the fact that this app is even free is just chefs kiss! and yea that’s all i have to say, thanks for reading my review and i recommend for you to download this. love y’all, stay safe! ♥︎"
"I am an editor, currently working on an analog horror series, and I am glad to say that your app was amazing! You haven’t disappointed me one bit. The effects are amazing, the options are amazing, the results are stunning, and overall I am just very thankful that this app exists! Because of the title of the review, I just want to make a suggestion with the retro option in the video effects. Do you know about the “TV Lines” effect? Well, I was hoping you can make a similar effect where it is held on the frame option. What I want how the effect to look is the same as Videoleap’s one where one of the glitch effect is called CRT. I want that effect to be the exact same as Videoleap’s if that’s possible to you, that’s basically all I ask for honestly. Anyways, keep up the good work and I hope you will see this message and take my request.

"I love this app a whole ton and I suggest it for beginners because it’s super easy to use and doesn’t cost anything! I use it for all my edits, but I have a few suggestions. I wish transitions were a little smoother, because it brings the whole frame with them and I wish they could add a smooth button or something. I also wish that they add more filters, meaning that you don’t have to work super hard and make multiple edits just to add a cool filter. Also, I wish they had a few more audios that could fit with “trends” I guess. I make anime edits a lot so more of a variety of audios would be amazing. One more thing, I wish that the Keyframe would also be smoother, like you could adjust how fast and slow the key frame is without adjusting the speed of the actual video. I think that’s it for suggestions but other then that I love this app and hope to keep using it more and more!"
"This is one of the best editing apps that I have ever used, and I use it to post videos, and its very cool. I was thinking of a recommendation, that you could add in the effects, hit video effects then there could be a flash choice, because I don't like making my own with Overlay, but otherwise, I haven't met another editing app better then this one. I love editing on it, because it is easy. Maybe you could also add something where you could make the video glossy, so we don't need to go threw mirror and stuff. But other than that it is awesome. If you want to make edits with Top Hits and stuff, there's a lot of songs from that, and you can use the music from videos you have recorded. It's a really good edtiting app and I would recommend it to anyone who likes editing and likes challenges and to explore, and mess around with stickers and more."
This app is amazing it is completely free. I first saw it from my friends and I didn’t know what the ruckus was about when they started. They told me that it was amazing and they couldn’t get their faces out of this app. So I tried it to see if it was worth it and I fell inlove with it the first day I had it. It has so many unique features about it. So many edit features and the best part all for free. It was the fact that you could do and use so many features that normal apps would make you pay money for. All I would like to say is that this app is amazing and I highly recommend it.( can probably be used for 9-10 up because I think this a safe app kids can use because you can’t buy anything and really no violence unless you import a bad video other then that yeah I think it can be used for the younger kids too) this took to long to write 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
"This is a very good editing app, but one little problem. I’m trying to download a video I made but it’s saying “There isn’t enough storage on your device. Try cleaning up drafts or free up more storage.” I did what it told me to do. I deleted all my drafts except the 2 I’m working on, and it still said the same thing! I thought maybe it meant all the video’s I used in my photos, so I deleted all the videos I used for making the one I’m trying to download. It still didn’t work. Than I decided to write a Review, but I saw it said “Update,” I thought that was the problem. When it was done updating, again it said “There isn’t enough storage on your device. Try cleaning up drafts or free up more storage.” I have no idea what to do. I tried everything!! It is an 25 and 33 second video. Is that the problem?? Please let me know how to fix it!! Thank you."
I love editing its my life even capcut it’s so entertaining Gacha I one of my top things too do in capcut I live this app just one thing though the app is great but over the many months I’ve been using this app it started to not work as much anymore you see I’m not sure if it’s a glitch with the app like if you use it much or maybe my iPads software doesn’t work with it anymore it could really be anything what’s happening to the app is that all my favorite sounds are not in my favorites and everytime I go to a new sound bar it will say there’s no WiFi connection even when I still have full bar so I decided to delete the game then reinstall it again when I got back on it ALL MY VIDEOS WERE GONE 😡😡😡 I was so mad and I was out of options too make the app work again so yeah that’s my review so I’m pretty sure this is a glitch great app but please fix the glitch 😊
"When I started, I didn’t know many features, but as I explored, about a month later I started using overlays, keyframes, velocity, things like that! CapCut is my #1 editing app because everything is free, and it has pre-made animations and effects that you can easily use by just tapping a button. I can’t explain in words how much I love this app!!! I would definitely recommend downloading it! I only have one complaint, but it’s still 5 stars. I’m on an iPad that doesn’t have too mic storage(I know that’s not the apps fault😅) and the more edits you make and export, the more and more storage it takes up (obviously). But I feel like it takes up a little more storage than it should, because CapCut isn’t that advanced so it wouldn’t have so much to save. But there’s nothing you can do to fix that, just my crappy iPad that has 32gb total 🤠 still the best app"
"I was really becoming irritated by the severely limiting special effects on TickTock, and then my girlfriend on TickTock suggested CapCut. I was totally blown away but what I could do with this incredible app. The effects were superior and I love The video transparency affects to create stunning videos. I am a creator and a singer however I would really like to see some nice echo and vocal effects in the audio section of CapCut. Stuff like allowing you to have different echo, reverberation affects when adding vocals to your videos. And also having control over the reverb and echo delay time etc. Additionally it would be fantastic to have a fade in, and fade out of the visual effects so they could blend in more effectively. Other than these two features this is my app it’s incredible and I just love love love it. Best app ever for special effects. Thank you so much CapCut 💛💛💛🧡🧡🧡❤️❤️❤️"
"I love this app, I use it to edit all my videos and pictures! I think it’s really amazing if your a beginner at editing. It’s very easy to learn. And they even have tutorials on how to do stuff on the app. But there’s one problem that irritates me. When I’m watching one of my videos I edited on CapCut sometimes it does not work and goes black when I can clearly see I did not put black on my video. And sometimes I can’t see my video. I’ve tried turning it off and on etc. But sometimes it finally comes back on and it’s not black anymore. Also sometimes when that happens I tried getting out of the app and getting back in. And then when I go back some of the things I did before I got out of the app is not there anymore. This is really annoying, there’s no words to describe how my much I hate this. And then sometimes I even have to start over. If you get really mad easily then I don’t suggest this app. Because it has a ton of beyond annoying glitches!"
"At first this app was really good and simple for me as a beginner. Now it has a lot of bugs, first of all when i try to make a edit it cuts of the sude of it like it is a phone sized frame. I have tried changing the crops but it won’t work. Also i don’t edit on a phone, i edit on a ipad. Another bug with this is that i like my ipad side ways but when i open up the app it is the opposite way, it is really annoying, i  have to remove the app first then open it again. Also sometimes when im editing and want to add a photo it says “sorry no photos.” Or something like that even though i saved photos for my edits litterly 10 secounds ago. These are the top bugs that i find really annoying. Please fix these, i really like calcut and it is a awesome app but when it comes to editing it has problems. I really like to edit on this app but with the bugs it has i don’t think i can anymore. So please the developers of CapCut pleaee fix these bugs."
"I’ve seen a few mobile editors, not too many, but out of the free ones, this definitely gives you everything you’ll need for what you pay for. While you may not get incredibly fancy features like a lot of audio tools, you do get a lot to work with. 
My only suggestions are, as mentioned earlier, maybe some more audio tools like free adjustments of pitch and bass and such, and a speed adjustment for the entire video. Many times I’ll be trying to line up a photo or video with the best of some audio, but it’s so hard because i cannot slow down everything at once and do what I’m trying to accomplish and I end up spending 5-10 minutes trying to match one beat to a frame. A simple tab that make the entire video slowed down or sped up, without impacting the individual speed settings if existing clips."
"Love this app so much. Maintains the quality of my clips, the lighting/hue/sharpen/etc is great. You can even import clips from Google Drive straight into your open project! Lots of cool effects, and while it’s simple and easy to use, the features provide me with lots of opportunity to make my edits more advanced if I put in the effort. 

My only complaints are glitch-related— 1st and most frustrating, the audio, once exported, is frequently a tad offset; 2nd, the exported product includes extra frames that I can’t find in-app (no matter how much I trim off); 3rd, several of the transitions lag or get jerky; and 4th, lastly, it could just be me, but I’ve never been able to get match-cut to work. 

Hopefully those 4 things will improve in updates, because it’s a fantastic app that I am super, super grateful to use for free."
"No ads, no subscription or pro version, no bars on the side. This app is perfect for people who are new to editing, it’s totally free and doesn't beg you for a subscription every 10 seconds, and the amount of editing choices you have at hand are amazing,  I’ve had capcut for around a year or 2 now and the only thing that I don’t like is the amount of storage it takes up but that’s not their fault. Definitely recommend it, and it’s easy to use on a phone, sometimes if you have big fingers though you’ll have a difficult time making short split videos or clicking the video in between the two splits if you cut them close to each other. Other than that this app is the best free app out there on mobile for editing/making movies and trailers, I’ve had so much fun with this app it’s amazing!"
"I really like the app and it is very easy to use, but there are 2 tiny issues that I’ve faced while using it. Every time I enter the app it rotates and turns sideways so I have to aggressively turn my device side to side to get it back in my preferred rotation. I also had a hard time adding multiple short pictures for an animation because every time I tried to check my work to see how it looked it was VERY choppy and I had to save the entire video just to see how a tiny snippet looked which made it hard to check mistakes. These both got so annoying it was hard to get motivated to even use the app. Again it’s very good and I suggested this to many people but theses issues really bother me so some how fix it if you can, not sure if it’s just my device but my device is very new so I would be worried if it was."
"I’ve been using Capcut for some time, and it’s been amazing! Though from the title, I have three minor complaints- nothing too serious though. 
Number one: you have to individually select the pictures/videos instead of being able to select and drag- which doesn’t seem too annoying at first, but kills your time when having to select hundreds of pictures at once 😅
Number two: You can only select one picture/video for overlay at a time. Again, it doesn’t seem too annoying at first, but increases later on. For example, using a green screen. The green screen would be the main, while the others that would be on top would be the overlay. So it just gets annoying after a while.
Number three: The animations sometimes don’t show up when you play it. 
That’s it!"
It’s an amazing app and has so many ways you can edit videos but it is glitchy and when I downloaded the app I noticed when I made my first edit that it was glitchy but my battery was at 23 percent so I thought it was my battery level so I charged my phone to 100 percent and when I was done making the edit and played it to see what the end result was and it was not as glitchy but still a bit glitchy. But thats my only concern about this app truly it’s a good app to do edits on and has lots of ways to make your edits fun to create it does not take a long time to get the hang of the controls it’s pretty easy to me. It’s a nice app and a fun experience I have been looking for a editor app that is easy to use because all of the editor apps I have downloaded have confusing controls and CapCut have easy controls and it takes a few minutes to learn them.
"I love this app! It’s really easy to use, it’s simple, the videos turn out amazing, and it’s fun editing with this app! There’s one thing in particular that i have a suggestion for though. The new feature where you can record yourself and use cool-trendy filters is everything i could ask for! But i just wish you could export sound from a video in your camera role and stop and play again the video with the same sound, if you get what i’m saying. Like a lip sync, you know? But you can also pause what your doing, get into another position, and start recording with the sound exactly where you paused the video. I just think it’d be much more helpful for people like me, and i hope you consider adjusting it so that people can do this little recommendation. Thank for reading, have a great day!"
"I LOVE THIS APP! It is easy to use and I love that. I love everything about it except for one thing... it consumes A LOT of storage and even after I delete projects, it will still fill my storage. I have tried to clear the cache and it will say it’s clear yet still my storage is full from this app. I have to delete the app every time I use it to clear the “documents and data” storage. I appreciate that this app saves your videos so that you can delete them from your camera roll without them deleting in the app, but once I edit the videos, the parts I take out should delete from the storage too or something because it’s such a pain. I end up editing like an hour worth of videos down to 10-15 min total then can’t save the video cause my storage is full. Please please please just fix the cache so we can clear the data not used. Thanks"
"So I’ve made many CapCut edits for my friends. However today everything was strange I tried to create another video however it did not work it told my my phone storage was full so I thought I had to delete some photos so I did then after deleting a lot I came back and it said the same thing I asked my smart bestie and she said to delete some of the videos you need after deleting like 20 or 30 it still said the same thing. Can you please fix this I wanna make more videos please.  
  
My opinion on the editing:

Overall the choices are very nice but I’d like to do some more transitions. Also some more effects I’m not saying the effects are bad I love them they’re awesome ! But they can get a little old by time but I still use them thanks for taking the time to read this, You should definitely install this app it’s the best video editor ever! 😊💖✅💚👌💐"
"Wish I could give the app more stars. All features are incredibly intuitive and can be quickly understood, which makes the app perfect for those new to video editing/edit videos for casual use. There’s also a hefty selection of tools which can even be overlapped to create more interesting effects. Everything is really so versatile, I feel like I can always learn something new to do. The best part of the app, though, is that it is COMPLETELY FREE!! There are NO IN-APP PURCHASES OR ADS, which is the downfall of every other editing app I’ve ever encountered. I actively worry every day that CapCut is going to introduce in-app purchases, because it’s genuinely unreal how GREAT this FREE app is. The best of its kind— if you have any interest in amateur videography, this app is a must. CapCut, if you’re reading this, please never start charging for features. I will cry lol"
"Ok um this app is amazing I’ve been using it for 2-3 years now and I still haven’t learned everything! But I have a few things I request you add. First I was wonder if we could had thing where you hold down on the diamond and there’s a animation mode where you put all oth the parts your animating with and they are in layers That you can speed up, move, and colorize with effects and filters. If you want an example look up flamango animater tut on yt. Also can you make the slowmos more smooth? Whenever you slow something down the frame rate starts to be all staggered and delayed so it makes it look like a low quality vid. Also um can you make a filter for a flash and fade effect? Where it’s a white flash and it fades but it’s looks like it’s on the overlay setting? That’s all for now but IM HAVING TROUBLE REDOWNLOADING IT 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭"
"It is great! No watermark, free, nice effects, my friend is a pro at this!! I'm still new, but can you do a little change with the storage thing? I have around 200 pictures of a video I want to do, and need to post a video for my friend. Sadly, it says that I need to clear up some storage, I made hard work with the pictures. ( I am doing a Gacha Life thing with CapCut!!) I made part 1 of what I am doing and that got myself around 30-40M! So now it keeps telling me to clear up some storage. I just get a mixed feeling of mad and sad, I really need to make part 2 of it but I can't. I also need to show part 1 of the video to my friend I was talking about earlier. I really want to show her how good I did with it! So, can you please fix the storage thing? If it takes a while that is totally fine, just do whatever to fix up the storage thing. In any other word, keep up the good work! 😁"
This app is great and easy! And I was pleased to see that it was free! But I think an update could be that you make videos and interact with other people on the app and then can put up un edited videos up on the different tab and you can go on edit and press done then it would send the creator a message/notification saying you edit it it for them and they can approv it and put a 1-5 start rating and if you do that you can like get stars which can get you something new and they add 3 things everyday but you might not get them and it will say better luck next time and you can comment on videos. Like a editing version of tiktok!! Ik this is a long shot idea for you guys to see this but I think it’s is a great idea. But you don’t have to listen to me!😀Nice Game!! Thanks for reading🦋God bless you all!!🙏🏽💗PEACE🔥
"Kinda bad. It’s so hard to edit the layers, I can’t really put text in there too, it’s really hard to just make one simple video, and when you’re editing the layers, even if it says like 3 seconds, it goes by so fast and it’s really just one second. I have a lot of issues with the app, but the ads, oh my god the ads... I mean it’s pretty debatable because I do have an Apple device, usually if I download an app on an Apple device I get more ads then usual. But the ads stop my editing in between here and there, and when I’m trying to edit something I lose my progress and it’s just very annoying to see that your hard work is gone just because of ads. REMOVE THE ADS! I lose hours of hard work and have to restart them. This one time I had been working on something for 7 hours, because it’s so hard to edit, an ad came up and BAM! Progress lost. Then after I tried it again right when I was at the end, of course another ad. So annoying. Do not download this app unless you want to lose hours of hard work. Developers, please fix this!"
"This has to be one of the best video editing apps I’ve seen on the App Store! It has lots of effects, transitions, animations, and more that you usually can’t get for free. And yes, it’s all free. This app is really useful when I’m editing my animations, and it’s especially great because there’s no watermark. There are a few things I would suggest be added. First, there is no key frame and what I do needs key framing. Second, I wish there was a way to add more video layers without it having to be an overlay. Maybe it’s possible but I haven’t been able to so far. And lastly, I would recommend an effect or animation that is a slight camera shake (I don’t know how to explain it better). So if you could add those it would be wonderful. Overall, this is one of the best editing apps I’ve worked with. Thank you for reading my review!"
"I love the app, its easy to use and understand which is hard to find nowadays and it says a lot just to acknowledge how someone who is hard of understanding as me can fully process how this app works. Tons of effects and options of what you can do with your video, fonts, stickers and etc. My only problem is that there is a bug with the stickers where the loop animation won’t process at times and I will have to find a way around it, other then that it’s amazing and I highly suggest you get it if your hard of understanding like me! I also adore the variety in about everything; tons of stickers for you to use and you can also import your own, multiple edits you can use on your video, tons of fonts you can choose and all of it is very easy to understand."
"This app is absolutely awesome. I have made so many cool edits with my brother and quarantine friends. This app has legit saved me from boredom 1000 times. It has cool effects and great quality too. Me and my friends made a music video to the “Ai Ai Ai, I’m your little butterfly” song. And since CapCut has the “remove background” button (that is free) we could make my friends little brother sour through the sky.... like a little butterfly lol. I would also recommend this to people who vlog. Between the awesome effects and translation, you can make pro edits! You can also make Gacha stories with it. The only thing I would recommend tho is more anime-ish sound effects and effects. I also would suggest longer songs, maybe real ones that are popular but I understand due to copyright. Yeah, other than that great app! ✌️😁"
"CapCut is a great app, but I think they need to update the key frames a bit and add more effects. I love how you can get rid of the watermark FOF FREE. I think the texts needs a bit more animations like vs but other then that you could consider them alike besides the less work. I think CapCut does need to let you do some of the work on your own, if that makes sense. CapCut is a good app for beginners, I think they should add stuff like making your own effect and what not, like how people will give you tutorials on flashing with the white overlays. I don't know why people think CapCut isn’t a good editing app, I think it may be the part where you don’t have to do much, as in you don’t put in much hard work. I think it would be cool to give tutorials on how to make your own effects, animations, shakes, etc."
"i have been using capcut for a long time now, and overall i genuinely love it. It’s my favorite editing app, and i feel as if it provides the most freedom out of other apps that i have seen. However, I have two suggestions. One, when adding music, to be able to import from your device’s files. I save a lot of music as mp3s from an audio program, so i think it would just be a lot easier if there was one more way to import. Another suggestion I have is to be able to turn off snapping without exiting the editor. Maybe on the overlay screen, there can be a button near the undo-redo feature where you can turn snapping on and off. Either way, I love the app so much and those are just two things that would make it so much easier to use."
"Hi creators of CapCut. I absolutely love this app. It’s the best and easiest editing app I ever downloaded. It makes it a lot easier for someone who barely knows how to do transitions. I don’t think I would change anything except one thing. So earlier I was making an edit for my fan page and I wanted to add a graph but it wasn’t letting me get any of the choices. Then I searched it up and saw that this option only works for androids which I don’t think is fair at all. Most people I know that have this is app is iPhone users, such as myself, don’t think it’s fair. So if it’s not too much trouble can you make it possible for iPhone users to use the graph option plus I updated the app and everything and it’s still not working. But other than that I love this app and can’t wait for other things you add to it. 

Sincerely,
CapCut editor/user."
"So my dream was to become a gachatuber but I knew that would never happen. So about 2 months ago I went to my friends b-day party and another one of my friends were  there. She brought her phone and was like “look I can make gacha videos.” So i was like “HOW?!?” And she told me get CapCut so I wemt home amd did that. I was expecting it to be awful like the other ones. But no.. I LOVED IT!!!! I made a lot of gacha life vids with it!!! So it fixed my dream of becoming a gachatuber. I don’t need to post it, i can just make it and feel good about myself 🫢. But the problem is the templates. I am still looking for one I used already because you have to reset them to get different ones. And they are all called popular or pop. It’s so annoying that I can’t find that one template. BUT THE REST IS GREAT. I just take screenshots and it makes a vid. So that’s my opinion!!!"
"I’ve tried multiple editing apps for my phone and by far, this has been the most advanced app. CapCut features more filters, tools, and effects than I could ever imagine I needed. There are so many tools to make your work the most professional and fit any genre. Some apps I’ve tried, distort the audio when exporting or crash right in the middle of editing but I haven’t experienced this at all. There’s everything from music and audio to stickers and filters and all sorts of visuals that make videos very enticing and fun. If you’re looking for an editing app, this is the best one. I’m 13 and have managed my way around the app just fine. Nothing confusing at all. I just keep finding new features to improve my work every time I edit something new.  I’m very impressed"
"Totally free, great animation options, super easy to learn and use. Compared to all the other apps I’ve used this one by far exceeds them in nearly every category.
The only complaint I’d have is when I add all my effects, animations, etc the app begins to glitch. Particularly with masking, when i try to playback the edit to check the timing it glitches, slows, freezes, or sometimes even crashes completely. I’m not sure if it’s just a system overload, but I rarely make anything longer than 1.5 minutes. It can be frustrating not being able to check my work without having to save the video to watch it or shut the app down before it is finished. Other than that, I’d love more effects/being able to alter the timing of the effects.
But honestly, it is still my go-to and for being 100% free this app is stellar! Love it."
"My absolute favorite and all time used editing app!💗 Love it so much! I really love how developers are adding new features like the video effects one and so on. It would be much more more awesome and beneficial for the users if the developers by any way can make new transitions! Just an idea- There should be an option about if the user wanna make their edits by using all ready made transitions or if they wanna make new transitions by their own! It would be an absolute banger then!🥰 Also, it would be really great if the quality can increase a bit. Whenever I post it in Instagram, it’s quality is ruined. Even if I save it to photos the quality isn’t that much good but if posting in Instagram it’s worst. Either ways, love the app! Perfect and awesome for beginners! Can’t get over it🖤 I absolutely recommend it!💗"
"Well, this app isn’t used often by gachatubers, but I am one of them. I struggle with trying to animate and tween, but with CapCut, it’s so easy! It has tons of effects, and it has everything! I made an Intro, in less than 30 minutes, with this app. I showed it to my little sister, and she loved the music on there too. It’s easy to work too. It has tons of stickers and options! You can do text and audio, and text is one of my favorites. You can pick an animation for it. Wavy, wobbly, shaky, etc. When you use overlay, (overlay is basically what I always use lol. ) overlay has options after you put in the picture. You can animate it. It doesn’t require tweening at all! I haven’t seen people always use this app, but they should! I love this app a lot! Please get it!"
This app is so cool!!! I love how it is free and you don’t have to pay for anything inside the app. I have some suggestions though… I wish that when you are adding a clip and you go to the ones that are provided you can actually change the text like the sugar babe clip for example: you click on it and put it in your video but no one wants a clip that says”sugar babe” on it and they just want the fancy animation with the word that they want to put on it. I really hope you can change that up if possible. I also wish that when you select the neon  thing so it outlines people with neon in your video that it just outlines them and doesn’t have fancy words pop out and boxed text because it ruins the video. This app is amazing and I hope you can take my ideas into consideration.
In capcut I was editing for a tiktok video to get a lot of likes tho and it was fun for me….to edit some people but something hapenned…..one day…I got to capcut cause I wanted to edit some people against cause I like to edit them to the people but when I put to make a video or idk?it says delete some of you videos and I’m like ok it’s easy so I delete some and still says that delete some cause it’s full and then I erased all of them and I clicked the edit to edit some video and then something happened…well It stills say it’s full videos but I erased them all..I didn’t have videos cause I erased it so yeah and haved 0 videos cause erased u know right? It haven to some people and I dis install the app capcut and go to the App Store and download it against and me have to wait and another day I checked and it wasn’t there the app as installed so I wait the other day and still and still I waited like 5 days and still I don’t know what to do with this tho now what should I do if I cannot get the app back forever and ever
"CapCut is an easy app and I use it for a ton of stuff, it’s perfect for beginners, or pros. I love that everything is free so I don’t have to pay 50 dollars a month just to get some special effects. But there is a new glitch where when I join CapCut, it switches my screen and makes it vertical, not horizontal. I have never had this problem til a couple weeks ago, and the only way to fix it is if I leave the app (not deleting the tab) and then join again. But one of my favorite parts is the watermark. There is no watermark and you can just delete the ending. I usually keep it so people know how amazing capcut is, but if you hate having a huge watermark on your videos use capcut!

Other than that the app is great! I just hope that issue can get fixed, and would totally recommend this app to fellow editors!"
"There is no exaggeration when I say that I’ve deleted every other video app on my phone. This app has everything they have and more, all for free. Some apps don’t even let you test out their other effects and other things without buying their subscription, this app is filled with loads of effects and transitions and so much more all for free and I didn’t know there could be a mobile app like this, it’s the After Effects of mobile devices. This review may seem fake or something but I can guarantee you that the reason for this positive feedback is that I make edits on Instagram and have been looking for a way to make my edits when I’m not home or on my pc. Good work to the creators, Ive shared this with others and will continue to do so!"
"So I started using this app about three months ago and I really like it I really like the develops and updates of this app I think it is very helpful for me in my editing I had to come on here because I really just wanna say thank you has built-in sticker is in the built-in all these effects that are just amazing and I really do want to thank you Guys
So my issue is whenever I am eventually editing and there will be like a problem where it will start lagging and I know this is happened with a few people I don’t know if it’s happened with everyone but I’ll eventually start liking and my and it won’t be as smooth anymore I don’t know if that’s the app itself or I’m just doing something completely wrong but can someone really fix this or tell me what I’m doing wrong because I really need this app to be in my life right now haha"
"This is a really good editing app! I LOVE it and it’s completely free plus it has no watermark which is so good and it’s pretty simple to work with however, there is a few things that I don’t love about it. 
1. They affects is a little bit bad quality. Also, the bling effects are kinda weird. Again I still love this app but this could be improved
2. The transitions aren’t AS smooth as I’d hope but it’s a completely free editing app so what do you expect? 
3. I don’t know if it does it to everyone’s edits but it makes mine turn out grainy / bad quality. That might just be mine though. 
I love this app and if those things were improved I’d love it even more but overall it’s such a good, free, watermarkless (😂) editing app that I would recommend getting if you don’t wanna pay for an app! 😁"
"So, Editing a video is so easy. We can all agree on that. But it lags really bad. If you do many pictures or even if you do three pictures it will lag. I was editing a video, Only two pictures with an overlay. My audio kept glitching out. A couple hours later i wanted to see if it was still like that, and to my surprise it was. Usually when it lags i close out of the app and wait a couple mins,, This app is my main editing app. I do understand that apps do have glitches and lags,,but this is somewhat weird and should only happen a couple times. But this has happened as soon as i downloaded the app. When i downloaded the app it was very laggy and wouldnt let me delete anything. I deleted the app and re-downloaded it,,,it got way worse. And i dont want to delete it again because it shows my process and how much i have gotten better. Please fix the glitches"
"Omg, this app is just amazing. I love roblox and gacha life and this is the best app to edit them with! It’s so easy to use and has so many cool effects! My most favorite part, it’s free! Not a single effect I use cost a single penny. I am so I love with this app omg. Though I was wishing there where other things. Like is there any way to add effects over the overlayed image/video? It only goes all the way to the back. Also, can there be a effect to make the movement smooth? What I mean by that is, when you make a video and the character/person moves around like the movement to smoothen out. That would be pretty cool. Just a suggesting though! Other than that, like I said, I LOVEEEEE THIS APP! It’s almost like videostar actually but all the good things are free! Thanks for making this app! It’s so useful!"
"luckily capcut isn't a gold digger like some other editing apps, it has several free effects and options that make your edit expensive without buying anything. for an example, video star is good alone. but MANY people have bought pro, and it's 100% better. unlike that, capcut is great free too! i do have to admit it was pretty plain in the past, but they've added GRAPHS and new effects, which really improves the app. i especially love the 3D effects, they're so realistic and fascinating! plus capcut isn't confusing at all, the main reason i drop most editing apps is because they're confusing. even days after trying to get the hang of it, if i can't, then i delete it. but capcut is very easy to understand and get the hang of, i really recommended it!"
To start of this I would like to say this app is super easy to use while giving you flawless work if you know how to use it. It is free and simple and easy to understand. Though I have become a good editor a problem is now occurring. The problem is that when I try to download it and share to my friends the work I made isn’t on beat which is more important down the line of editing. Though I have checked many times if this was my fault It proceeded to fail even though I have  tried a different method of recording and sending it. I know for a fact that it isn’t me but the software. So if you are sending your edits to friend and have the problem to spread awareness. Thank you so Caput for making me such a good editor though and I hope to see more success in the future.
I love this app so much and the best app they just added new Slomo I don’t even know how to explain this is the best app I definitely. Suggest you get this app and if you love to edit then this is the app for you I’ve had this app for two years and I love it so far you guys should definitely get it💝 this app is the best thing that happened to me in my life since I love to edit my friend told me about this app so I got it and I became addicted I just can’t explain how much I love this app it’s literally the best and if you do end up getting it and you like it then you said tell your friends about it it took me a while to to learn how to use the app but I watched some tutorials and it definitely helped me but this is it for the review just telling you guys you should get it
"I wanna start off saying I love this app. It has many features and editing skills that I love and couldn’t live without in my day to day life, honestly. However, I can’t give it a full 5 star rating because recently, for about a month now, none of my effects, the question mark at the top of the screen, or anything else have been working. I’ve looked up solutions but can’t find anything other than the app being banned in India. I don’t live in India! This is an issue for me because I can’t even report the problem to the app due to “No internet connection”, which I am connected to. All of my other apps work just fine too. I would love to give five stars, but I don’t know how to fix this. Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you. :)"
"First of all, this app is the BEST! It has so many stickers, effects, fonts, and much more! I was a very beginner at editing but I improved a LOT by just this app. Overall, it’s great! Love it!

But there are some problems too. I’m not saying the app is bad but it’s kind of annoying when I go into the app(in mobile) and it just appears as vertical and I need to turn my device to make it horizontal. Please try to fix that. A suggestions is that I think you need a bit more music to add because there’s not a lot of choices plus I can’t get the music I want. Maybe add a search bar at the top and some similar things like that. (Maybe the music from Apple Music?).

I hope these wishes for CapCut come true so you can make it even better! Good luck!"
"Greetings, Capcut creator. I am very pleased to say that this app is amazing! Absolutely worth my time. Making edits on this app is so fun and it never takes me too long. The no watermark really helps because I don’t want to waste money on an editing app just to remove something.  But I have suggestions to make this app even better even though you might not see this.
A- Fonts
  Now we have a lot of great fonts in this app, although I feel like we could use more Sans Serif or just Serif fonts to make it more regular but to really step it up. Frankly, you can use the different language fonts in English sentences, I feel like to make our editing jobs more modern we could use more round, and bubbly fonts. 

Example: Champagne & Limousines, Blacklisted, and etc.

B- Animation
    Don’t get me wrong, the animations on this app are everything. Even better than most transitional animations. However, I feel as though we need graphs to make our own video animations. Font animations are okay, but I feel like it’d be cooler to add the same animations for the fonts as the pictures have.

-Sincerely,
          Anonymous
P.S. - I know this update would take a while, but you’d benefit off of it. Trust me xx"
"Hi , Hope you’re staying safe, I’m a professional video editor and I’ve been editing video with Adobe premiere for something about 10 years , But last year when I installed CapCut for a test to edit a video I realized that What a amazing app I was missing , So it’s been 1 year now that I’m editing mu videos with CapCut & I can say this is really Amazing and powerful ! Even better than a pc software like Adobe premiere ! Because CapCut is much easier , Faster and more professional to use ! .... You’re app is amazing but I have a advice that I think it can help CapCut to be better , , I think it will be really great if you guys add a ( Font-adding ) option in Text section so users be able to add their own fonts to app , It will be really great !!!"
"Ok. CapCut is SUCH AN AMAZING APP! The transitions.. dude, ITS UNIQUE! :D But.. please :( add more transitions, please??? I know there is a lot of transitions but add some more to (in) transitions and (out) transitions. The (out) transitions are kinda good but it needs more. Only in my opinion tho- also I don’t know but please add more and rework to voice affects. Plsssss? Some of the voices sound a little a like. And the chipmunk one sounds a little distorted because of a background noise? Idk if it’s the voice that’s being distorted. And the “distorted” voice doesn’t really sound distorted. It’s just a really low pitched voice- :< also add more voice changers, for example it’s distorted, kinda like and alien but it’s wavy voice, and add like bass booted, auto tune, and others :D would love that, anyways great app :)"
"I love this app! It’s a great beginner app if you’re just getting into editing and it’s also great if you’re more advanced! I’ve been editing for 9 months and I can constantly find new things to try and different editing techniques all on a completely FREE (yes, there are NO in app purchases!) app! I do have a few suggestions tho! 1) better audio capabilities. This app doesn’t have many things to do with audio, maybe add some better voice changers? The sound also doesn’t get very loud so that’s a bummer:/ 2) split screen templates! There are ways to do split screens but you have to completely do it from scratch so it’s a bit of a hassle. It also is very hard to do if you’re a beginner so this is something I would very much enjoy! Overall I highly recommend this app!"
"I’ve been using Capcut for a few months now and I’d say its my go to editing app! The fact that it’s absolutely free and super easy to use makes it a lot less complicated for beginner editors. I’d just like to suggest a few things that I have issues with. One thing for sure is to add graphs so the key frames look a lot smoother and better. Secondly, adding some more fonts and animations for the texts. I think there should be in and out animations for the loops texts so I don’t have to save it separately to add it in. And maybe let users make custom animations too? Its just my opinion, but I think the app will be a lot more compatible if that was added in. Overall the app is great and I hope that the developers see my opinions for upcoming updates :]"
"Capcut is amazing! I use capcut to make a lot of edits and funny skits. With capcut, most of the magic and aliveness comes from the editing. At first, I was very puzzled on capcut, considering I switched from IMovie, which is a great app. But I eventually came into turns with it, and now capcut is really easy to edit with. They have a ton of effects, transitions, and you can crop your videos and manage volume. There is so much more, but it’s a lot to explain. It would be all good things though. Even though I am great full for managing how to edit in capcut, I feel some people might have some trouble with editing because there is a lot of things you can do and people might be confused. Other than that, I love this app so much and I continue to make new edits everyday!"
"I’ve had capcut for awhile now. There has been new effects/tools that I have been very excited to use.  Right as that happens, a terrible glitch comes marching in. Any time you click on filter, animation, effects, graphs, literally anything besides your photo album it says, “ No internet connection. Try connecting to the internet and try again. “ Even if I’m connected to the internet, it doesn’t work. I’ve tried reinstalling it, looking at tutorials, etc. I may be just blind while looking at this kind of stuff but I cannot find another way to make this work without installing a VPN or Proxy. Proxy’s are dangerous, and VPNS don’t work because their “ not safe “ according to my IPad. And who wants to turn it on every time their using capcut? This is ridiculous. It ruins the entire point of capcut. I can’t find another way to report this glitch so I’m writing it in a review. Thank you."
Yes I love this app it’s amazing for fan edits and I love it the only thing I hate abt this is it takes up so much storage for no reason like I delete all my edits and deleted all the music in the app deleted all my templates even went into setting and all that I could see the was the documents and data and I think the app picks up what I do online or something like that cause that’s all I can think of I’m not blaming CapCut saying they’re doing that but that it like there nothing in the app or they just remember all the music and videos you made and collect that and keep it and it just stays like that even after they’re deleted. So yeah I loved using this and still would love using it if it wasn’t for how much storage it takes up cause i only have 32 gigabytes. Lol
"I use it on every video I have to edit it brings the features you need for videos I didn’t know until I really try it myself it’s best for all video edits until now am in love with the app it has every mood you want for example your in a sad mood and you want to edit a video about you being sad Capcut has it all happy, sad, bored everything.
I’ve been using the app for over a year.
 What I like most about the app is that it free you don’t have to pay for unlimited there is nothing like that other apps you need to pay unlimited to use special features and effects but Capcut has what the other apps want you to pay for. 
Capcut is the best recommended for people who like to edit videos or to make videos it’s the best."
"Overall this app is good for beginner editors! I love that everything is 100% free because I really don’t want to pay for a professional editing app. However, there’s only so much you can do with CapCut since everything consists of presets. It would be great if you could include options to make your own transitions, mask layers, animations, and import fonts. I also find it very frustrating that you can’t use combo and in/out animations at the same time for text and you can’t use animations on effects. The velocity/speed settings are also very glitchy and don’t create smooth videos. These are just a few suggestions that I really hope you take into consideration. Again, I do like this app but I’ll probably move on to a more complex software that gives me more creative freedom."
"This is an amazing app, updates are incredible. I just love the feeling of people doing Roblox edits, they turn out so good that it inspires me to do some (only a few are successful:D) so here is some of the experience:D I don't like the quality of the screen I use because I use an iPad, please add an option to change the screen size to fill:D it just makes the quality easier for my videos! Also, add some more cute filters. (This part of the section is NOT ME hating on the filters) I just don't feel like there could be enough beautiful filters and if you can add some more updates to Shortcut and that would be amazing! Sorry if this is short but amazing app ❤️❤️❤️❤️ recommend it for beginners, anyway, that's all! Bye"
"This app is very easy to use and a very nice tool to make a montage or anything you would really want to edit. I just have one problem, when deleting a video on capcut, I think you should add a recently deleted feature where all your deleted clips/videos are there and you can recover it just like when you accidentally delete a photo on the photos app. If you could add this feature it would mean a lot to me. I am a very clumsy person and recently I have been deleting a lot of clips that I do not want deleted (because i want to save storage) but most of the time I usually delete the videos I am editing. Please respond to this review and add the feature! Thank you!"
"I am an amateur filmmaker and I work only on FCPX, it’s been my learning platform and I’ve really enjoyed my experience with it! But, I always wished I could add more to my videos… different animations, filters, etc. I was making a fan edit for a friend as a joke and in trying to find the app to do that, I found this one. Literally have only used it for a day and it’s already changed my life. It has every special effect I’ve wanted to add to my past videos available… FOR FREE. Honestly, this app has pulled me out of my long term editing block and now, IM DYING to makes new one so I can use all the cool features this app offers. To all the hard working people out there who made this app, thank you, you guys are really cool."
"This thing is a literal powerhouse. This editor has many customizable text styles, many stickers, multiple layers, all that jazz. The one thing that makes CapCut stand out from the rest is that it’s 100% FREE! No in-app purchases, no monthly subscriptions, no ads, no watermarks, no NOTHING. Seriously, what else can you ask for?

However, when I export certain stickers, the app just crashes, and the video doesn’t save to my camera roll. I tried multiple times, same thing, over and over again. Nope, just crashes. I really hope this gets fixed soon.

Overall, I would recommend this app for mobile content creators. If you are looking for a mobile editing app, you’ve came to the right place."
"For beginners these is extremely intelligent to start for an app, experience also helps a lot but that is for more advanced. Honestly, capcut is pretty good for advanced as well! Quick and short for promising edits! I got this app when I was 9-10 I am now 12! And I love this app so much it is incredibly useful! At first I was so confused, but seeing these talented editors kept me pushing to be as great as them! I now personally think I am awesome at editing, I have posted edits of mine before but I mostly like to keep them to myself, which still brings me pleasure! Every time I watch them to myself it still makes me happy, I’ve never upgraded to a higher editing app, because capcut, still learns some how to keep the vets to stay<3"
"Ok, I have been using this app to edit for about 2 or 3 months now. I’ve gotten the hang of most of the stuff. But there’s a ton of things that can make the app better. Like being able to put multiple translations, and graphs. I know some of the transitions already come with motion blur but it would be so cool to have the option if we wanted to add motion blur or not. Also I’m gonna mention graphs again because they would make the app a lot better to use for editing. A lot of people also want graphs not just me. Something else that would be awesome Is you know the effect that is called camera focus 2 I believe? Well if there could be one where it clears the picture more quickly that would be great! Other then that the app is overall a great beginner editing app."
Realistically this app deserves five stars but there’s one problem I keep having with this app I don’t know of other people have been having this problem too or if I’m just going crazy but for some reason every once in a while when I upload a video from my camera roll through CapCut all of the audio my voice goes away the games audio stays it’s just my voice that goes but when I check my video in my actual camera roll my microphone was on and you can hear me speaking up for some reason the CapCut just completely gets rid of my voice which is kind of annoying because I’m YouTuber and this is the editing software I used to make my videos and until this gets fixed CapCut is gonna stay at a 4 star from me
"All my friends have downloaded a app called CapCut. I didn’t know what it was and it seemed really cool because you can make these really great edits on TikTok! So, I downloaded it myself to try it out and to be honest at first I was so bad at it I thought I might just delete it. But my friend told me to not delete it and that it would get easier if I tried. I grew to love the app so much! I have so many more followers on TikTok and likes, sometimes I just like to make a edits in the car when I’m bored. I think it’s pretty good the way it is and a lot of people have been asking for different fonts, OK here’s my theory... YOU ONLY NEED ONE! Do you see if you post it on TikTok you can put different fonts on it there. Have a great rest of your day or night!❤️"
This is the best easiest editing app ever it’s better than tempo better than vinkle better than video star well video star u can edit really good but it’s really hard it’s it’s better than viva cut and plus it’s 100% free no water marks no paying everything free and u have stickers text like I don’t know the name of all the things but it’s really good if ur a beginner and if u master it I’m pretty sure your going to stay on the app but CapCut it would be waaaaaaay over the best if it added that u can can change the color of things in effect and especially party because they have hot pink and red alert but I would like it if u added color changing to those or something but yes I highly recommend this app it’s the best
"CapCut is so far my favorite editing app. The layout and tools are simple and efficient, making this perfect for beginners/quick edits. But this doesn't make it low-quality. In fact, I've been using CapCut for 2 years now and have gotten great feedback from others. Another high is the CapCut watermark is out of the way, only showing up towards the end of the video. I would totally recommend CapCut to people with somewhat powerful devices. 

One minor problem is the app can get extremely laggy and slow. For example, if I moved an on-screen item I might have to wait a fat minute for it to actually move. This can get in the way of usage of keyframes. Other than this, CapCut is pretty great!"
"This is by far, the best editing app that I have come across. I would like to suggest some features for the upcoming update. Shadows and strokes for overlays, speed for text, more animations for text and possibly animations for overlays. (For ex. a softer shake loop animation, jiggle loop animation but instead horizontally or both or all directions) possibly more shaking effects or jiggle effects for the actual video footage(again, possibly multiple directions). I would like speed for keyframes, (and a way to control the speed and see the speed). Also, is there a way for you to be able to add an in animation, a loop animation, and an out animation for text at the same time? Last, please add a feature where you can add your own text."
"hello stranger that is reading this ! before you download the app please read this , I personally love cap cut . It helps me with a lot of stuff for example if I’m editing a photo at the beach or one of my tiktok Roblox videos it’s awesome ! I love all the cool effects on this app but it can cause a little bit of trouble depending on what device your using to edit    .... If your a person who doesn’t really care for small differences on the quality of apps then this is just right for you ! It has many cool features you can even add your favorite music to your edits I’ve only had it for about 2 weeks and only had a little bit of trouble . Many people use this app and currently I love everything about it <33 thank you for reading dear gal/boi and I recommend this app to everyone 😗✌🏼"
"I am literally in love with this app. I made so many edits and videos by using this. There are so many things you can do in this app! So many different combinations you can choose from and make your videos unique. Although, I have 2 small requests that would make this better

1. I love making AMVs but when I insert GIFs, it just becomes a photo from a random scene in a GIF. I would really appreciate if you would let GIFs actually be GIFs instead of just photos

2. It would be cool if you could change the pitch without changing the speed. I also like making cosplay videos with music in the background and I like to make it look like the character is singing it. But, there are only so many versions of a song you can find on the internet. If you don’t get what I mean, take the song Control for example. All the male covers of the song is high and the character I’m relating to has a deep voice. I made the video slower, but I can’t make it too slow or it would look weird. I hope that makes sense.

Other than that, I would defiantly recommend this app, 10/10!"
"If you are new to editing this would be a perfect editing app to start with or stay with. I have just stuck with CapCut but I am thinking of using other apps after I check out there reviews.

I like CapCut I have been using it for a long time to make my edits. There are a couple glitches but they don’t effect ur edit. I wish they would add new transitions, like where it blurs the whole video and not just behind the “object”. CapCut has really been updated since I got it! Also they should update the filters, some of them are kinda just well um crazy… 

              But anyways I really like CapCut and I would suggest it to all editors!     Have a nice day random person who read this."
"Hello! Never really make reviews so I apologize in advance if what I’m saying is either vague or not specific 😅.  The app, overall my favorite. It’s very quick and easy to use and I’ve been using it for a couple months. Since the recent update though, there’s been a bug that I rely on. One being the stickers. They don’t seem to load, as for the transitions do the same. Whenever I tap on a grey square (what the sticker icons look like) sometime it would load the ones I’ve previously put in a clip, but not the ones that I haven’t. They show up saying that I need to check my connection. I deleted and reinstalled the app and that didn’t do anything but lose clips :/. Thanks if you are reading this!"
"CapCut is the best editing app l have ever used l like how everything is free! I been using this app for about 2 years! But l do think it could use some changes! So yea these are my suggestions you could maybe add in CapCut? : if there was a 3D button? My edits need these! It would make the app 10X better! And maybe add like more animations! And if there was a custom animation? That would be really cool! Maybe add some more stickers but overall the app is really good ! If you would add those three things that would be great! But it’s okay if not! But yea it’s really easy to use,make a edit. And l love that it has a short cut to make a edit? And there alot of temples! So yea overall 5 stars! I recommend this app! 👍😁❤️✨👋🏻"
"So, I decided to write this review for a few reasons. One, I’ve been getting the “No internet connection.” for like 4 days now? I have VPN and everything! Everything else is working perfectly fine! If it’s a bug, or anything..please fix it! Two, It’s easy to understand, but maybe for newer editors, give them a tutorial? I’m not sure if you guys already have one, but…that would be helpful! Just a recommendation! Well, I guess that’s it. Overall, this is a wonderful app! I use it so much! Keep up the updates and awesome work! I’ve used it to edit so many videos and the results come out great!!! Again, please try fixing this weird bug, or whatever it is…I’m not sure if it’s just me, though. Haha. Anyways, thank you for reading, developers! 😃"
"Best editing software I’ve had! But many bugs :(
Yesterday my sound stopped working on capcut… I’ll make it specific on what I’m saying. Last year I filmed my friends birthday, and it was one of my favorite videos, but yesterday, the sound stopped working! I tried muting it then muting it again, turning my iPad off then on again, and then updating my iPad, but nothing worked… and lots of my other videos don’t have sound either! Please fix this bug because I miss the sounds to my videos :( and I waited till today to see if it got fixed but it didn’t! Please fix this bug! It’s annoying and I want my sounds back!
If that gets fixed I’ll be very happy and satisfied, please fix it!"
"i’ve had capcut for a few months now and i’ve noticed a few things that are wrong with the app. first, there’s no graphs. it’s all premade transitions. The keyframes are almost useless. Nothing is smooth. If you do use keyframes, it looks horrible. Second, you have no coloring section. And they’re all premade. So I can’t make my own coloring.
And finally, your speed settings. The slomotion is SO laggy, it makes me want to ball my eyes out. And your app is really only used for velocity’s, and there is t even a smooth slomo. I loved capcut because I wanted to become an editor, but I didn’t have the money to pay so much money every few months. And it all made sense, but it was so different from any other editing app. There isn’t even motion blur (tracking). So, if there’s any way you can fix these problems, it would be a great app."
"There’s a bug that needs to be fixed. When using an animation, the animation doesn’t do the whole video/ picture, making it reset to its original posture and making it look weird. I thought that I needed to update the app but noticed it’s been updated two days ago. It was working fine not long ago, I think the update messed it up or smth, idk. But the animations aren’t working. I even did a new project to see if it would work again or even resetting it, but nope, still doesn’t work. Hope it can get fixed asap, before my motivations leave. But take your time, no rush :) Update: I really wanna use CapCut but it looks ugly :(

Update 2: Ugh!! It did it to one of my other projects! Please get it fixed quickly, Im this close to exploding 🤏"
"So I really love that everything is free and it has great transitions but it’s like really glitchy.. like when I’m making a really long edit and I need to watch what I’ve got so far to see if I like it, it glitches a lot and gets froze while I’m watching it. I don’t know if it’ll be better once I save it but... also, when I save photos from like google it only shows some of them it doesn’t show all of them when I have it on the setting that it shows all of my photos. But other then that I really like the app it’s just a bit glitchy and maybe needs an update but overall it’s a really good app and I recommend it especially if you have a hard time figuring out how to work apps it’s super easy to access everything and yea it’s a good app."
"So I’ve been using this since I’ve started editing, I heard of it on TikTok and decided to try it out. It works really nice, this is the easiest app to manage out of all the others I’ve tried like vllo, video star, and inshot (for me anyway). The only issue I found that kind of made me want to use another app is the fact that I made a video that was 43 seconds long (for TikTok) but when I exported it into my camera roll it only said 42 seconds. Why is this? I tried editing my video, making it shorter and then longer, deleting my other projects, etc but nothing seemed to fix the problem that when exported into my camera roll it slowed my video down by one second, therefore the transitions were slowed. Can someone help please? Thank you."
"Why I love it: why i love it is cuz you can edit and all types of stuff it helped me editing I know how to screen record and it is awesome you have to update it to make the pic move which is not a problem! I can also share which makes me happy cuz I can show edits to my cousins me and my cousin edit with each other we love to see what we make 

Why I hate it:it says to delete storage over and over again and if I don’t I can’t edit idk why that is a thing but I HATE it. It makes me mad and I just wanna delete the app it’s kinda laggy to which I hate or it’s my iPad or WiFi I also hate it because you can use it without WiFi but no animations! I know I can use it at home but still it makes me mad I just wanna edit and edit sometimes I have to watch tutorials but not a problem but besides that it’s awesome!❤️"
"Capcut is one of the best phone editing apps out there in my opinion! It’s perfect for making instagram edits or any type of video, but there are some things that could be added to make this app even more better and useable. I would like to see more masking options and shapes for the masking tool, and more transitions that are subtle but also very smooth. Transitions for the cubes that are simple like going up and down/or side to side would be nice as well! Capcut has so much potential, it just needs more added to its already great platform! I would love to see more filters, but mostly more transitions and masking options! Thank you for reading my review hopefully if the developers see this they consider my request."
"It has almost been a year, since I’ve been using this app. It all started in Mid-January, at the time I was new to editing so wanted to try something new. And that’s when I was introduced to CapCut.
When I went on there, the app was okay, and showed me the steps I needed to make my videos really fun/epic.
So here are a few improvements I think you guy should make, first of all, when you done making a video- (an edit) or whatsoever, can you make and attempt NOT to tell us to exit out of the app, because my phone can sometimes have trouble functioning, so it’s either life or death here.
But overall I think everything is good, and keep improving! ❤️"
"i’ve been editing with capcut for a good while, but im lacking some stuff in the capcut app, this is just a PLEASE add this to your app if you can!

1: graphs
i’ve been doing some edits on the app. safe to say, its really easy to make edits and super fun with all the effects, filters, keyframes, etc. but, making an edit with only keyframes is way too hard. a simple transition can take up to an hour to succeed with no graphs. please, add graphs.

2: overlay limit
when i make edits or try animating with characters, the overlay limit can make me miss a leg or any other body part. i recommend to make the overlay limit unlimited since its way too hard having to keep exporting and all that and eventually having to use another program.

3: the lag
there’s an intense amount of lag if you add a few effects, overlays, or simple texts. and i’d really love if you fix the issue

4: off timing
i’ve had this issue editing for someone a video with only subtitles, the subtitles would be on time in the app but out of the app its off time (slightly) and its very confusing. please fix this.

that’s all, thank you!"
Ok so I got this at first I didn’t get it then I got used to it getting it more and more now thanks to this app I have more followers I want to thank you for making this app because it has saved my life I started using this app when I started tik tok now this has became the best app ever existing I add my own music and I sometimes do edits and take them on CapCut and add some effects so they shine more there is nothing wrong with this app its amazing the way it is and the animation is so cool it helps me with my edits I’m so glad I got this app it saved my life I spend some of my time making little stuff but with a lot of effects and animation cuz it’s so cool for me I rate this five starts to the best app every created in history🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🥳🎊🎉❤️
"I already reviewed but I would like to edit it because I have complaints. I like CapCut and it’s great to use but I don’t know if this is just my device or a glitch on the app. When i use the text box, it won’t let me choose any fonts anymore other than “SELECT”. It used to, but not anymore. I was not happy about that but eventually just dealt it. Then, a few weeks later, I couldn’t choose different colors for the font anymore. It kinda froze the font stuff only. I haven’t checked the animations for fonts yet, though. Anyways, I don’t like having only the “SELECT” font and having to be stuck with pink as a color font. Again, this might only be my device, but if not, please fix this! Thank you 🙏"
"This app is good, mostly because it’s free and stuff. And you can basically do whatever you want on here. But here are my problems. As you know, most people on TikTok use this app to edit for their edit accounts. But, as I see i’m better apps, such as VideoStar, they have all these cool effects and stuff that people on Capcut don’t get. Not to mention some of the buttons working in and out at random times. I had to reverse a clip for an edit but it did not reverse and told me to “try again”. I did and it didn’t work. I had to re-download the WHOLE app entirely over this glitch. And other buttons don’t work as well, either. Please fix this lr I promise you, people will just pay the short amount it is for VideoStar and other apps like AE and will not use this platform to edit. <3"
The app is overall extremely simple and can edit very effectively. Is it possible that in a future update we could have a more powerful green screen filter with the chrome key? The current one is not that advanced and I still see some green and some glitches. I would even pay to have a premium version of it. I feel that this is the main thing that the app lacks. Also if there could be equalizing and white noise cancellation for audio. These things would make me love the app even more. But overall very good and thanks to the CapCut team for working hard on their updates. The app is amazing.
"This app is great whether you have experiencing editing or you’re new to the process. My biggest frustration with it, is when I send in high resolution videos from my iPhone to my iPad it seems to convert it to a lower resolution. Even if I up it to 2K/4K on CapCut. 

Additionally, it would be a great benefit if the app would sync across all devices. That may solve the aforementioned issue if I could upload the video on my iphone and then pick up the editing on the iPad. The only reason I’m sharing this feedback here, is because there’s nowhere else to send feedback to the app to ask for assistance. Which would be my third complaint.

Outside of that, this app is super powerful for being free! I highly suggest downloading and using this app."
"CapCut is my #1 fav app! It is the best app and a great experience! All the transitions are very cool and the stickers are amazing! You can even extract an audio FROM your video, which I like, and it’s a great app overall!

All though it is a great app, here are a few suggestions:
For audio editing, I feel like you guys can make it even better by creating a little icon that lets you create 8D audio, which makes the audio echo in a smooth and a clear way. What you can also do is add “realistic” sound effects. When I say that, I mean like in audio edits, it has a little sound effect that makes noises such as an echo laughter, etc.(Sorry if that doesn’t make sense) :’)

For transitions, you can add a different icon that says “Transition Effects”. This icon can have things such as oscillate! And with that, I feel like CapCut can be an even greater app!

Now, one last suggestion: 
For the text, maybe try and make text fonts that are much more unique.

Anyways, those are some of the suggestions I would like for your next update in the future. That is, of course if you get a new update."
"Very amazing good for edits and got me many likes!!! One suggestion is that you should add 3d space, that could make it more like after effects and more like Funimate and overall just better edits so please consider that and also maybe more effects like the displace effect from tiktok and more filters like the ones fan pages use. Also maybe a community page that we can share our edits on and also templates instead of shortcuts and maybe people can create templates because that would be cool because then people can do it and it could be a trend. Overall a really good app and capable of a lot of things! Just please read this and maybe consider adding them to the app."
"I use this to make gacha content everyday and it’s so easy to use. I was an original KineMaster user, and thought that it was the superior app. When my sister downloaded this app, I was extremely salty and refused to use CapCut and only thought of it poorly. KineMaster got an update and I was a little disappointed with the new KineMaster, I tried out this app, and wow! It is great. I apologize for roasting this app in a positive KineMaster review. That was like 6 months ago. I love this app and it was the best app choice I ever went with when it comes to actually editing. Please note that KineMaster is my #1 app, but I only really use KineMaster for tweening. 
Thank you for (hopefully) reading this through! 
Love ya, see ya, bye!"
"This app is my go-to for editing. It’s straightforward to use, reliable for different types of videos, and overall just so engaging and fun. 100% worth checking out. Favorite editing app I’ve ever used, and I’m so appreciative that it’s free. 

My only request is to please allow a ‘change for all’ option when it comes to text styles. Like when I change the spacing between words, I would love to have the option to do it for all the text in my video and to continue with this format for the next text, similar to what happens when I pick a font/size. If that option could be added, that would be AMAZING! 

Thank you :)"
"Now I have to say myself, this app has helped me out a lot and I’ve mastered almost everything in this app. I have loved these new updates coming out! The only thing that’s making me concerned is that it always says that my storage is full. Now understand that my device is old, and that makes sense (but I only have 5 or 6 apps right now, and 3 of them I need to download again because I haven’t used them). So that should be about 2 or 3 apps only, I may have a lot of photos but my settings says apps are the most. So I’m thinking CapCut is taking up some of my storage, but of course I love this app and it does practically everything every other app does. I hope people see this because I would like to know if it’s just me or if it’s other people too! I LOVE THIS APP THOUGH!!"
I like CapCut cause it has brought out the creative side of me and it is also and excuse to go on my phone while not playing video games. I like it because you can use it in everyday life. Now I would say I’m probably a 2 star editor but I know I can get better. But my friend and I were thinking how it would be really cool if CapCut had like almost a tik Tok on it so that you could post your edits in CapCut and not have to get other social media cause you no some kids that are good and like editing and want to share them can’t because they don’ have tik tik or instagram or Snapchat. Other then that I love CapCut but think about my proposition cause it could really boost the people who use you app.
"This app is very good to me, I just got it a few days ago and only used it once to make one video, and this turned out to be my favorite editing app. I recommend this app. There is so much stuff. Chroma key is one of my favorites, look it up if you don’t know how to use it. It’s very awesome! The one video, I made, I love it! Thanks to capcut, I can make awesome videos!

It might be hard to use, but trust me, you’ll get used to it, I got used to it very fast. There is so much buttons, yeah, it could be confusing, but that’s because there is so much editing tools! Again, I HIGHLY recommend this app.

This is just my side, but I hope you guys make awesome photos/videos, thanks for reading this review!"
"I really love CapCut. I've been using it for three years its easy to use and has many things you can use for editing, but I would really love it if you were to add an advance mode (which is free) where the user can use 3D text and video. I aslo recommend more 'Party' effects. And more opitions for 'Mask'. For example, you can have a 'Mask the person' button which cuts the main thing in the video or picture all by itself. I know theres a low possibility of you seeing this, but if you do I would definitely use the app even more than I do. I also recommend getting more 'Basic' effects and 'Animations' for transitions. Thank you, an bye."
"I’ve been using this for months and I’ve almost mastered this app, I love it. This app has features that other apps make you pay for. There’s no premium, it’s all free which is crazy because it feels like a premium version of an app. While this app is amazing there are a few things they should add. 1; the ability to merge text/overlays with the video, this would mean if you merged them effects would apply to them, same with adjustments and movements to the original video. 2; The ability to toggle motion blur on/off for text and overlays, which means when they move (with keyframes or animations) it has motion blur, and would be much smoother/professional looking. Otherwise this app is all I need, thanks!"
"I’ve had this app for about a year now and I must say, this is BEYOND incredible. The presets are very useful, and effects are marvelous as well! The fact that you can remove the watermark FOR FREE is such an amazing feature; I never have to worry about missing out on anything because I can’t pay for it but instead all is free! I love the templates that they include as well! I feel as if it is so simple for me to get around and find out new things! You can completely animate anything with the presets and key frames (which comes very handy when feeling a little creative)! I don’t find myself changing apps anytime soon! In my opinion this is the best editing app for beginner editors and EVEN pro editors! This is definitely an underrated app."
This is the best editing app and I’m so happy with how many effects there are for me to use on my YT videos this is definitely an all in one editor. I just wish that when I was adding effects that I could split the effect bars bc sometimes I want to put the same effect split up into multiple different parts very close together and I hate having to go all the way back in the effects and scroll through to pick it again. I just wish we could cut and extend effects. I hope someone who created this app sees this and make an update to allow this feature. People love ease of access and not stuff that is difficult. I love this app and it’s amazing that’s its free 9.5/10
"Now I have no hate against this app because it’s very simply and easy to use. Even though we have presets, you can also make your own transitions you just kinda have to think about what you want to do. The effects on this app make the clips look 10x better! Even though I really like this app there is one thing I feel like it’s missing. GRAPHS!!!
I just feel like it’ll make transitions much more smoother. I love the fact that we have presets but also that has a downside. We can’t control the smoothness of it. The duration thing doesn’t help either because it only handles how fast it goes. Please make an update with graphs! I’m sure it’ll attract more people to the app especially with the no watermark thing."
"This app is so cool. Works great for making fan edits! There’s no watermark and it’s all free, which I absolutely love. The transitions are super smooth and very cool, however, I have some suggestions! The first being that there could be smoother transitions, like some similar to After Effects? After Effects isn’t a mobile app which is really a bummer, so it would be beyond amazing if you could make something similar for mobile. The second suggestion is more fonts to use for videos, but I do love the ones already listed! The last suggestion is more cinematic transitions, effects and filters! But other than that this app is great and I will continue to use it! Thank you!"
"I love cap-cut. This app is my life and soul, literally. I love all the cute effects and filters available for all. What i love is that there is no premium and no one had to “pay” to get the ”premium” life. The only thing is when you aren't on the app for so long you have to download it but you can’t because of where you are placed. Cap-cut has so many cool features that i am still figuring out. I have helped a business woman get customers using this app. The only other problem is that you don’t understand what to do unless your introduced to all the equipment.  It took me about 1 year to finally make some decent videos. I hope you like this review and pick this one. CAPCUT IS AWESOME SAUCE!!!"
"So, I was looking to make edits, correct? I came across other apps like Kinemaster and(I don’t remember the name) to use. But they were both extremely difficult. So, I saw a Gachatuber using this, and I was needing anything at that time. So, I downloaded it and starting fiddling around. I got the hang of it and made things I am very proud of! But, due to lack of storage I had to delete many projects. This also helped me out with a school video project once! Anyway, I am here to thank you for making such a simple app. Also no- I am not a bot they used to write a good review, I honestly did enjoy this app. 

Edit: I have more storage now so hopefully I don’t have this issue."
"This app is amazing! Anything that is a bad review, they probably just don’t know how to use the app. Now I do have some few suggestions first of all maybe whenever you’re trying to cut something it’s kind of hard to click on what you can do you know, so I was thinking you could like have a little button in there for like the video part. Also I would like some milk more filters I have seen some that I really like but they get taken off more filters please! Oh and for beginners maybe like a introduction video if you choose to help you figure stuff out. But otherwise this is a great game and I don’t know why he doesn’t have a five star review."
"I really liked this app. It was so fun, easy to learn, and was easy to make videos on! I have used this app ever since December of 2020, and I still use it. Although, there’s problems on here that need to be fixed. When I tried loading up the sound effects, it said: “No internet connection, please try again.” And I checked my WiFi and it was perfectly fine. Another thing, when I exported one of my videos, it didn’t go the way it wanted. It made my video very laggy, and the quality was horrible. Could you fix this issue please? If you do, thank you.
And, after a while, I had to delete this app because it was taking so much of my storage. I’m sorry if I can’t play this app anymore. I loved this app and I can’t play it because it took so much of my storage."
"I love this app! There are lots of effects to use and sounds and you can even add some audios from videos. However, I kinda wish they had more effects like Video Star and Funimate. And it takes up a lot of my storage. Even if I delete all of my projects, it’s still full. It’s great and all, but some things should be worked on. There are a lot of glitches when I add effects they don’t work. It doesn’t happen most of the time.  I also kinda wish the CapCut ending video at the end of each video wouldn’t be added by itself all the time. I usually forget to delete it and I post videos on TikTok so I have to take it down and repost it. I mean, I love this app! It’s great! Just some things should be worked on."
"So this app is awesome!! I got it like 3-4 weeks ago and I love it!! Everything is free and the effects and animations are amazing 🤩 but starting yesterday I was making an edit and basically half of the animations wouldn’t work because they claimed I had no internet, which wasn’t true because my Instagram and all my other things that require wifi were working. I tried re starting my phone, logging in and out of wifi, etc nothing worked! I just deleted the app and now basically none of the effects or ANYTHING is loading😐 PLS FIX THIS I RLLY LIKE THE APP!!! I already sent feedback. Honestly I need this fixed bc I have an editing account with a big follower base and I can’t just stop uploading

UPDATE:
After several days of it being deleted I redownloaded and it still didn’t work😐FIX THIS PLS"
"Capcut is so fun to use. It’s not to hard and I get things done quickly when I use it. Don’t forget that it’s literally FREE!! I don’t know any other editing app that’s actually free, you always have to pay using other apps. Like video star, I use it only the free things though. I’m not trying to disrespect video star it’s just that not everyone can pay to use the things on there, it’s completely fine though. All I’m trying to say is Capcut is free and it’s easy to use! Even if I had all the money in the world, I will always use Capcut. I really hope Capcut doesn’t put prices on anything also, why should they? Their app is doing great! I love it."
"Hello there creators, hear me out.
I’ve been using capcut for almost a year now and I definitely would recommend it to someone that are novice to editing. I know that u creators are working really hard on capcut to give us the best and let us experience a great time with capcut. The reason why I’m giving this a 1 star is because of a glitch or bug when changing the speed “normal section”. Whenever I try to change the speed using the “circle” it doesn’t let me. Whenever I drag the circle to a certain speed, it just gives me a different and totally random speed. This is really really annoying, at first I thought maybe I should delete the app and reinstall but I did multiple times and it’s still the same. Please, fix this bug. I use an IPad 8th generation. 
I would give this a 5 star as soon as it’s fixed. Otherwise, I’m moving to another editing app.
Thank, 
Ryan."
"Cap is a very good editing app from beginners, CapCut was the first editing app I used (I started using it in June of 2021), it’s very easy to use and locate the things on the app. I just got the new update and the added graphs!!! Honestly the key frames are pretty annoying but they work. The motion blur is more of a direction blurry but they do have a transition called then and now which is sort of motion blur. The slomo is awful and there is no good shake… the text is fine, but I wish you could use a loop animation and a in and out one at the same time. A lot of the issues would be small fixes/changes to the app but would make a HUGE difference. Over all the app is very good for a free app with NO watermark. I actually LOVE this app I would just love to see changes in the future to make it better."
"I really like this app because I love making anime edits. However there are some problems with exporting. In some cases when I export it will show a black flash (very short) that isn’t in the edit when I hit play. Only when I export. I even ran it through a new project, cut out the black flash, and when I exported it, the flash was STILL THERE. Another thing that slightly irritates me is how you can’t see some overlays. The app is dark, which makes it very difficult to see black overlays. (Maybe you could add a light mode.) I also have new effect ideas. Maybe add tiles (like in alight motion) and have keyframes (or animations) for effects. Other than that I really love CapCut and will always use it! :)"
"This is a really great editing app, and really easy to use for beginners. I watch tutorials for CapCut and can understand them very easily. The only thing is that it take up lots of storage and its wont let me edit anything, even if its just for fun and I’m not uploading it or anything. If this is possible, I would like adding a photo into a video easily, as an example, I used to use clothing star. The function “PiP” in the app allows me to add a picture in a picture in a video if that makes sense. Like, 2 photos in one scene? Of course, if that is to much stress, thats fine! I would definitely recommend it to others!"
"Every single time I delete all of my projects (because I’ve already posted them) it’s still takes up 2 GIGS of my storage! I need this space for other things like Tiktok so that I could post these projects. But even when I do post and get rid of these projects the app still says it takes up 2 GIGS. When I click on it to see if it’s just the app size, it says it’s the “documents and data” that I have stored on CapCut. NOTHING IS ON IT!!! so HOW is CapCut taking up all of this room!?!?!? Overall CapCut is good but this one problem really bugs me. CapCut is a great editing app and SUPER easy to use, and maybe I’m just being dramatic but if you could please help me with this problem."
"Love everything about this app. I do a lot of shooting and editing on my phone and this app has been AMAZING. A lot of the other apps you have to pay or upgrade to get certain features but with CapCut you get everything free. The only small thing I’ve noticed is that when I export the finished product the audio and video are a little out of sync. Just by milliseconds or a second but I’m able to fix it by using another app to detach the audio and line it up. Still playing around with some of the other features but would be great if there were some tutorials on tricks and other cool features like masking, etc."
"So, this is a great app for beginning editors like myself. My favorite part about this app is that everything is free!!! Unlike other editing apps you don’t have to create an account, pay for pro features, or watch ridiculous ads. Just add it to your hearts content! One thing I do recommend is that you let us film videos with background music. I also think that a lot of people don’t use iTunes so maybe you could let people use other music software‘s/apps so we won’t have to screen record things to extract the music. I’m gonna wrap up this review, but I definitely recommend this app and hope you get it as well!"
"The first time I downloaded this, I was amazed! It was super useful, and the effects are SUPER fun to use! But when I log back on today, and try to download another effect, it said I have internet connects. I thought that it’s a simple fix, so I disconnected then reconnected from my internet. But it still didn’t work- I tried to look up what the problem was but I found nothing. Now despite my unfinished projects in CapCut, I deleted the app, then redownloaded it thinking something would happen. But the same issue occurred once again. 
Please help! Is there anyway to fix this?? It would be such a let down if I couldn’t download any effects in this app... and it’s also not just the effects, I tried adding text, but I couldn’t even change the font!"
"This is a really great app! I use it for lots of my edits and it’s really easy to use especially sense it’s free but there’s one reason why I can’t rate it 5 stars. Thats of the lag. I edit on my iPad all the time and it gets really frustrating with the app freezes or can’t keep up with an edit I’m doing. I get really annoyed and just want to shut off the app while I’m in the middle of a edit. I don’t really have this problem when I use the app on my phone but it’s always my iPad (Which I prefer to edit on) I’ve tried re downloading it and deleting some of the videos in the app but nothing really works. So if you could fix this bug that would be wonderful! Other than that, great app! 😁"
so I realize whenever you get to a certain amount of storage in as a very very time consuming editor I like to make sure that it’s very good to make sure it’s on the exact same points and I like to have all those overlays. But the only thing I would fix about it is well there’s two things him I would let us use more than one font when we’re texting like just let us use two or three maybe. The next one I would like to say is when we have storage filled up I don’t feel like we should have to go clear everything and make sure that everything‘s fine honestly it made me mad every time we had to do that so those are the things that I think just need some work to fix and yeah Have a wonderful night everyone
When I started using this app it was really good since I have a fan page on both Charli D’Amelio and Maddie but it could use more the graphics are really low and I need to quality higher whenever I post it on TickTock or any of my other social media‘s it just like the quality it just becomes really static he looks like a really bad Wi-Fi and graphics it just needs more features honestly I’m being honest maybe animation more animations for the text and the auto caption doesn’t work I’ve tried it multiple times maybe update that other than that it’s a pretty good app and it’s really easy to learn on my video star am I like it personally you don’t have to like it but I think it’s really good
"Y'all need to add an option to merge two clips together please, it would make my life so much easier. Whenever I make a split that's just slightly off it would be easier to just merge the two split clips together again and then make a completely new split but because there's no merge option I have to make a bunch of splits that are unnecessary and make editing very confusing. Not to mention, if I wanted an animation to last a specific amount of time, I couldn't do that since the animation only lasts as long as the clip is, and the multiple clips from splitting so much make it impossible to get the length I want. Everything else is perfect tho xoxo (but that's a really big issue tbh)"
"I love this app so much all the features are really good and it’s completely free. You don’t have to pay for extra stuff like taking a watermark off etc. But what really bugs me is that there’s no way to make an account. I recently had to change my phone and I’m not able to get that data back from all my edits which makes me really sad. Maybe there’s something I’m missing I don’t know but that’s how it is for me. Right now I’m not even able to re download it for some reason. I’m tryin but it’s not letting me but that may be something with my phone. Other than this I really recommend the app, best editing app ever."
"this app is amazing !! ive been using it for a few years now and all of my edits are made on it. it’s super easy, pretty fast, and comes out with some pretty sick edits !! i love it and i rlly recommend it for beginner editors. this app has helped me a lot and has given me a lot of references for certain things. it’s easy to use and to understand; from what i can remember, it only took me a few days to pick up on the controls and the stuff in it. if i have to say anything “negative” it is that there’s no smooth slowmo so, i recommend using VSCO or Timecut. i use timecut. velocities are easy to make, transitions are pretty easy, and overall, it’s a rlly good app. 10/10"
"…questionable, to say the least. 

I’ve had nothing but great experiences with this app and the new update (dated ~4/23) won’t change that. However, when editing videos, there will be audio lag that normally isn’t present. For example, when editing a video, I will listen to it before I export it, just to make sure I don’t have to go back later. However, when I listen to it, it sounds perfect; when I export the video, the audio is very clearly off by a good half-a-second, maybe even more.

Other than that, this is my go-to editing app! It’s great and I always use it for almost all of my needs. (However, the template button for iOS devices would be good too!)"
"I’ve been using CapCut for a while now for edits, and I’ve found that it is super easy and useful. Until recently. Lately I’ve been having the problem of when I click on a video to upload into CapCut, it takes a really long time to load, and when I click done after cropping the clip, it takes FOREVER to load up and import into the video. I know that it isn’t my WiFi because it has never been like this until now. Now, I may just be being impatient but I used to take half a second to import into the app, and I wish that it would be like that again!! Please help me or fix it. Other than that though it has been wonderful and perfect for my edits!!"
"Hey there. I am Techspert from Instagram
Guys I just wanna say that idk it's just for me or is it for everyone that capcut after it's new update is acting very very weird.
1) brightness slider is very very strong now, I can't even increase it to 1, because it's just becomes way too bright even at 1 level
2) Same as vignette slider, it's very strong now. Not working properly.
3) Whenever I am exporting any video then I can see pixel blocks in my video around many areas.
..
So guys overall the experience is completely changed after it's new update. I reinstalled my app today due to some storage issues and when I tried to edit my reel it's just not helping.
I grew my account from ground to 70k only because of capcut. I use capcut for all my reels but I don't know if I can use it anymore. 
If you guys ever see my msg so please try to bring back old adjustments back to capcut, I am trying to edit a reel from 3hrs but it just isn't helping at all.
Also I am using an iPhone 13 pro so I m definitely sure that it isn't my Device issue.
So please if you see this msg kindly check what's happening to capcut app coz I really can't use any other apps. All other apps are kinda weird.
I hope this problem resolves soon."
"first off, this app is GREAT! i use it for loads of my edits and once you get the hang of it you can make loads of great stuff, but there’s always things i wish the app would have… 
for example: 
being able to lower the opacity of effects, and slow them down
a lot of times i want to use effects like the flash effect but i kind of just want to lower it if that makes sense 😅 and slowing them down kind of speaks for itself, sometimes a lot of effects go by really fast and it would be better to slow it down to fit the edits 
i only have two suggestions that come to mind right now but those would be really useful!"
"I have worked with multiple editing apps. This is on my top 3 list. It’s great for beginners and I easily adapted onto it! I’m a Roblox + Gacha tuber and this app has been with me half of the time the other was kinemaster. But we’re talking about CapCut right now. It’s great for beginners, easy to use, rarely laggy ( only twice within a couple months ) , and best of all there’s so many effects to choose from! 

Editing apps usually eat up my Ipads storage but this one lets you delete your projects/videos. And that definitely helps me! My storage can’t handle much (32GB) and this app doesn’t make it harder to manage my storage!!

Something that annoys me is that when I’m making an edit and i need to spin an overlay, after time it lags and makes it go crazy on its own. I feel like this app should be able to handle something that’s just spinning around perfectly fine. If that would be fixed this would be a perfect 5 star review. 

Please fix my issue! Thanks for taking your time to read this, and goodbye!😘⚡️

"So this app works sometimes at least for me but I have tried a bunch of things. I’ve tried refreshing the page, turning off my device, closing my tabs, clicking off the project I’m making and then try again but over and over again this app has glitches when I’m trying to make videos. The weird thing is it will skip clips that I put in and just goes over it. The sounds that I import will get cut off and it’s super weird. Overal I would give this app a 2-3 out of 5 because the things you can do are pretty cool but this app glitches a lot for me. I still think you should try it out if you really want but I personally want to try a different app to make videos because this one doesn’t work very well for me. ☹️😬"
"I love this app, I think it’s the best editing app that I have tried so far, but there are some problems that I have. So first I’m going to tell you about all the good things, there many effects, you can make cool animations, add what ever sound you want, not that many to no adds at all, and even more. But the bad things, it used to let me change the opacity on the text and background of the text that stuff but I can’t anymore, I don’t know if it a glitch or people just can’t do that anymore but if it’s not a glitch I would really like that back, and  I really can’t think of anything else other than other tiny glitches. I love this editing app, and think it’s amazing."
"this app is literally everything an editor could want.  it’s free, that transitions are amazing and already made. i use this app for roblox and normal edits and it’s great with doing velocity!! just a few suggestions to make the app even better 
-the option to put more than one transition on a clip! like wobble and bounce 1 or pan right and distort right. i do this already by exporting the video and just adding more to it on a new project, but it would be LOADS more productive if it was an option already!! also, maybe the ability to create transitions or shakes of your own!! 
-more effects!! some examples of cool effects would be stuff like motion blur, shakes, stuff like that would be amazing!!"
"i love this app and highly recommend it to anyone starting out editing, but something happened earlier. i was going to make a edit on capcut, and it told me that i had insufficient storage. so i went and deleted a bunch of things so i could make the edit (i had 1+ GB of storage after deleting). I went back to capcut, and it still said i had insufficient storage. So i deleted the app to redownload it, thinking it might fix. But i ended up not being able to download the app again, and it just has a swirly loading thing instead of actually downloading. My IOS is up to date snd i have storage available, yet it will not download. Please fix this issue. Thanks."
"I personally don’t like this app because it doesn’t let me download fonts and it would be better if it had graphs. When I try and import the font it doesn’t even show I my files and if it does then it shows up grey and doesn’t let me tap on it, literally going to get anger issues from that I was literally I personally don’t like this app because it doesn’t let me download fonts and it would be better if it had graphs. When I try and import the font it doesn’t even show I my files and if it does then it shows up grey and doesn’t let me tap on it. I was literally punching my phone LOL. Also you Guys should add motion blur like the one on vs where it’s called “vs motion blur” and where it could be able to change the settings it would be SO MUCH BETTER instead of paying for it. And you guys should also add coloring like vs it would also be 100x better. And that’s all bye :p"
"I had the iPhone X but it broke so I didn’t have it for a while after that. I ended up getting the screen fixed and then the iPhone ended up being bricked so it had been about a month and a half maybe more and I finally got an iPhone 8 an old one so I downloaded this app to realize the animations have changed there’s now three selectable styles in,out and I believe combo. I can’t find the apply to all button like I had before. I don’t know if this is my fault or a very poor update. So far everything else is good. (Edit) it was my fault, I was doing animations when I meant to do transitions. Changed rating from 4 star to 5 star."
"I honestly think capcut is really easy and for
People who say it’s not and it’s not an editing app your honestly just using it wrong the amount of things you can do on there is good. However I wouldn’t compare this to any other editing app. Other apps have more options and variety of options when editing, not saying capcut doesn’t but they’re software is different such as vs and ae you can’t compare those depending on the app or software itself. They’re all amazing apps and softwares for editing but due to how good you are will obviously change your perspective. So if you know how to edit on capcut you would honestly realize how easy it is ."
"So I’m minding my business about to use it when it tells me I need photo access but it was weird because I already had access, I didn’t mind it so I went back to give it access when it didn’t give me the option. I was super confused so I deleted the app but the next thing heartbroke me when it told me again it needed access to my photos and the option again wasn’t there. All my edits were gone and then I tried it with a different editing app and it worked, I’m really confused and sad. I can’t tell if it’s my tablet or it’s the app, I’ve tried many times but the only options it gave me was Siri and notifications. If you can, please respond to this review or try and fix it. And if it is my tablet also let me know. Bye^^"
"Most problems I experience with free video editing apps consist of 30 second time limit, big logo, etc. stuff you have to pay for to get rid of. But this one is great, no logo, no obvious limit (I only make 3 min long videos max though, so can’t say for certain), a lot of good effects, basic tools like splitting, deleting, trimming, moving. Another problem I had with a different app (24fps) was that it would lag when I would try to play the video and it would pass from one clip to the next, but this one is super smooth and has no glitches. Love it! Also has great animation effects, def recommend overall."
"I’ve only been using CapCut for a few weeks and absolutely adore it! Editing is super easy and the layout is very easily understandable. However it feels that almost every time I open the app I’m hit with “insignificant storage” even after deleting multiple apps, hundreds of photos and videos, and clearing cache from as many apps as possible. I never faced storage issues until this app. If you have insignificant storage your also not allowed to even view your drafts until you clean up. This is incredibly frustrating. Other than that issue, the app is incredible! and people really seem to enjoy my edits that I put so much work into, all thanks to this app."
First of all I am still very confused on why the removed it in the first place it was very helpful and saved a lot of time but now I have to use more of my time just to one thing. Also they would put it back and take it off again like if ur trying to get us mad it’s working bc A lot of people are now more confused. Like please say if ur going to keep it or not bc I’m not wasting my time on a app that can’t help me with normal things but overall it’s still a good app it provides access to different filters that make a video look good yet I’m to tired to try and make a velocity edit when u guys have it to us and took it off but that’s really it
"Capcut is an overall good editing app but I do have a few issues with it. 1: The overlay feature broke. I was making my video which was around 3 minutes long so I spent a lot of time on it, but when I exported it, I noticed all the overlays somehow shifted on their own like 10 seconds ahead, and I couldn’t even edit them cuz they didnt show on the overlay editing tab. 2: Text always overlays the effects. I want my effect to also affect the text, but when I add an effect and then text to my video, it just overlaps the effect which is kinda boring. Overall it is a good editing app but please fix these bugs and issues I have with it ok? Thanks!"
"So before this all started happening CapCut was the best app I’ve ever owned but I tried exporting one of my videos, it said your camera storage is full please go check that out and come back so I deleted a few my videos and photos and,I tried to export my video again and it said the same thing,so I literally deleted all of my photos I only had 15 photos left and four videos,so barely anything in my photo storage so I tried to export the clip again, because I needed that video and it didn’t let me it said the same thing so I’m literally don’t know why you’re doing this,I literally only have 15 photos I don’t wanna delete all those because those are literally very old memories of me and my family so please if you fix thank you!"
This app is amazing I’ve been using this app for two years now and it has so much stuff to do. Especially to make Roblox edits i’m pretty sure a lot of people use ROBLOX and edit from this app and it’s amazing! But today I was going to make a Roblox edit and I found an update that has been gone! It was of the Velocity thing it was in the style catory!⚡️ and I know it’s gone i’m making this review because I just want to let Cap cut know i’m really hoping for the update back that update was amazing and I was hoping a whole lot of people who is trying to make edits out there.😅but keep being awsome with your app!!💕
"This app is fun and amazing for edits. Although i don’t recommend tweeting gacha life on it cuz there is a small max of layers, it’s still nice to use. There are so many effects and animations and you don’t even need to pay! There is also no huge watermark unlike KineMaster and cute cut. There are so many options the text, animations, effect, filters and more! Once i saw the ad for it i thought it was a big scam but then i saw people were using it on tiktok and i was convinced it was good. After i got the app i noticed that it was super easy to get used to in 1 day i knew where everything was from animations to effects. So over all i do recommend CapCut for you."
"Capcut is a perfect app to edit and make awesome things! Some great youtubers, tiktokers, and others use it for edits or videos about things like roblox, gacha, or anime. But, it’s not all perfect. First of, I think there should be more voices to say text. Not all people like 2 types of male and female tones, and not all can be used. I was also hoping it could take up less storage, since on my device, it’s always low storage so I can never even use the app. I usually need it, but end up in disappointment due to the storage problem. Lastly, I don’t have the option for the templates? I’ve been really wanting to make a trend but could not due to this problem. I hope you can update the app!"
"This app is actually pretty good considering what it is, and I’ve made a lot of stuff I’m proud of on CapCut. But there are some problems, of course. Like the fact I can’t click on one of my videos because I’m out of storage, I just want to watch it. A way you could fix it is possibly letting the user click on the video just disabling access to adding things. Yes it would still be annoying, just less. (For me, at least) there’s also a few other problems but they’ve been stated quite a bit in the reviews already, so I won’t list them off right now. Other than those problems, it’s a great app. It works really well."
"Honesty this app is amazing it has amazing beginner stuff, but I feel like it could be better. Don’t get me wrong I love this app it’s just, I think some more filters would be nice! Like…some of the filters funamate has like what I’m saying is the overlays and the shapes! Also idk if it’s just me but LITERALLY EVERY Roblox character glitches. And u CANT find any green screen ones! Like when I’m trying to make an edit they ALWAYS mess up. Anyway, the lag. Just the lag. It’s horrible idk if it’s my phone but I doubt it. I’ve deleted so many edits just to make new ones. I really hope someone sees this because I feel like some of this stuff REALLY does need to be updated. Anyway have a good day!"
"I love this app, it is working out for me. I would never think to find an app where everything is free and works wonderful! There is like cool transitions, it’s really easy and organized compared to other apps. And it is just cool, try it out dudes. 

 But I have a suggestion, I would love that pictures that are gifs are able to keep motion. You know what I mean? Like gifs are able to stay gifs, that would be amazing because the only other method I find that makes that happen right now is making the gifs a video which consists of me video taping my screen and that is a long process which takes my album space."
"I absolutely love Capcut. there really aren't any limits when it comes to editing, because everything can be done, really.  Its also quite easy to use for beginners! The edits usually come out looking professionally done, which is also nice. And its all free. Which is super helpful to a young editor like me. However I have ran into a newer glitch, to where every time I go into full-screen to review an edit, then try to leave it, it literally crashes my whole phone. Like, my phone freezes and then powers itself off for about a minute. This has really gotten on my nerves considering the fact that its the only app that does it. But other than that, Capcut's awesome."
So when I got this app I would make trash edits and didn’t really like the app because people would say this app is trash but it’s REALLY AMAZING 🤩🤩🤩 it’s such a easy app to edit and understand and I like how it makes you an edit by itself and everything is free!💗 I like this app for tiktok edits also😄and maybe can you make more updates? Also I like the new effects you added whoever made this app is a queen👑/king👑 and the music is also free and not much adds! 👍 none should hate this app 😊 but if wanna tween I suggest to use their apps. I tried tweeting in capcut but it wouldn’t let me add more layers!😭 but that’s the only problem 😢 great app🤑
"Hi CapCut, I really do love your app but I do want to make a few suggestions. I had made a few edits and videos using the app but then someone deleted the app and my videos were deleted because I didn’t get to save them to my camera roll. So if you can, could you maybe make an update where if you delete the app you can save your projects? It’s like a backup for CapCut for when people delete the app and get it again their projects will be saved. I think that this suggestion would be really helpful and useful to other users using this app. Thank you for reading this!"
"as someone who has tried various mobile editing apps, I can say CapCut is one of the best. However, in order to make it better, there are some things that need to be changed. First, the storage issue. I’ve deleted tons of photos, apps, restarted my phone, etc. and still...I am unable to create a project due to issues with storage space. It doesn’t make sense. I’ll be making an edit and leave the app, come back, and then I cannot continue due to this storage bug! Second, after rendering my video, clips and audio are out of sync by a millisecond, it’s a small issue, but pretty big when I depend on hitting certain beats in an audio. Third, I love the app, but I cannot continue to use it with the storage issues. Thank You."
"i’ve been using this app for almost 3 months now without any problems and it’s definitely my favorite editing app that i’ve come across. However, about a week ago it stopped letting me extract sound from my videos? it just says “cannot extract” or something like that. i’ve tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and restarting my phone and other stuff but nothing seems to work. Every video i’ve tried to extract the sound from hasn’t worked. This is just frustrating because sound is like the base for my edits and i cant really edit without sound so i haven’t been able to use the app at all. I still gave 3 stars just because this is the first time i’ve ever had a problem and i really love the app."
So capcut is a really good app I’d recommend it but there’s a problem with the keyframes and I’m not comparing but a lot of good editing apps have graphs and It’s really hard to use keyframes and make it look smooth without graphs again I’m not comparing this app to the others this ones amazing too! But it would also be a lot more interesting if you add transitions onto keyframes because someone like me usually adds the audio then overlays for the photos and video but I can’t do that here it would also be cool if you could adjust the speed for a transition like a graph would for keyframes? If that makes sense. But I’m very pleased with the app it’s just hard to work with!
"I feel like you should DEFINITELY add more songs and be able to search up the song you want. I’ve been looking for one song for so long that’s IS in there, I’ve used it before, I just can’t find it again. Please look at this and consider doing it! I think this is a good kid friendly video maker app. I would definitely suggest it, I hope 🤞🏼 this review gets noticed and y’all update the app. My friend is making her way to famous.(maybe in 8 years). She has more then 100 subs already, And she started like a 3 months ago! This app is amazing for videos and photos! I love making my Gacha club edits into vids with this app! So to bring it all down, this app is great!🥰🥰🥰"
"CapCut is an awesome app. I use it all the time to make funny videos. Nothing is wrong with it, and it seems that so much more can be added too to make the app even BETTER! I have used CapCut for so many things, especially when I’m on a road trip, but sometimes when I take a picture when I’m on vacation, I see something I don’t like and I want to get rid of it, but I can’t. So I just have to keep retaking the picture or video until I get it just right. So my suggestion is maybe add an eraser, so you can erase things you don’t want in the video. Anyways, CapCut is spectacular! I would definitely recommend! Thanks!"
"Overall this is a cool app but when it comes to glitches this would be the top 1 editing app. One of the reasons are when you guys make edits on the app TikTok but when you edit it I feel like you guys ignore the glitches that are worldwide, for example: when an overlay has a mind of itself? (Key frames commonly). I would be GLAD if you guys fixed that, but also I recommend you make a velocity graph so people don’t have to do so much work to do that. I know you guys probably see that on TikTok, this is why people don’t necessarily call this app an edit app when you guys probably want to be referred as one.  Once again, OVERALL THIS IS A COOL APP 

P.S you may need to check your coding because they may need an update."
"So to start off I just wanna say I love this app, it’s so easy to use and just super awesome and I don’t have to pay to unlock some extra features but it’s missing one thing, folders. So I like making gaming clips it’s what I do and it’s just relaxing for me but I also make other stuff too on this app but there’s no way to organize all of my edits, like stuff that I made a month ago will be all the way at the bottom and so I have to scroll pass a bunch of my edits just to find the one edit that I made and it’s just annoying so that’s why it gets a 4 star. But once they add in a folder feature I’ll immediately give this app a 5 star."
"This app is really good for making simple edits and is perfect if you are a beginner. It has loads of presets, effects, transitions, etc. and the best part is that it’s completely free! But there are some issues.
 1) sometimes its very laggy, which is normal for any app but its hard to see if the transitions and animations are smooth. 
2) basically all presets, I've been using CapCut for a while because its easy to understand once you get the hang of things but you can’t really customize the transitions and animations
3) no motion blur option, I find that apps like video star are extremely confusing and kind of expensive so when I found CapCut I was happy to find a free editing app but there is only motion blur and other blurs on the presets which means i can not add it to transitions i make with keyframes 
4) no graph, graphs make transitions with keyframes a lot more smooth but there is no graphs for the keyframes

There are some more things but I think that this is still a great app and really simple to use I would definitely recommend getting this app for editing"
"I was in need for a good editing app. I’ve tried many others and none were as good as this. Capcut is all you’ve ever wanted and more! It is a great editing app and you can do so much with it. I use capcut to edit all my school videos and they turn out sick. It allows you to add music and adjust the volume of it, it allows you to add cool effects in the beginning and throughout your video. It also provides you will cute and cool stickers to include in your video. It is not complicated to use but some of the buttons are unclear, you’ll get used to it though. I recomend this app no hesitation. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR, GET CAPCUT!!!!😃😃😃✌️🤯🤗🤠💗"
"I’ve been using this app for a while now, and I must say it’s truly amazing. I’m a really beginner editor and this simple app helps a lot. Even though it’s ‘simple’, it also has tons of features and if you use it right it’s a pro editor. 
I’m having great fun with it, and every time I edit I learn something new and apply it.
Anyways, I have a few suggestions:
1 - You should add the ‘mark effect’ to text!
2 - For the ‘mark effect’, you should make it so that you can draw your own portion of what to cut out so it’s more accurate
3 - PLEASE add the ability to add effects to the background without it being on the normal video/image. For example, I add a video, adjust it, and make a blur background of the video. I would LOVE to add effects to the background. PLEASEE add this! It’s probably what I want most out of these!

If you’ve already added these, I’m sorry to bother! I didn’t realize there was an update and I’m actually updating it right now. Thank you so much for the amazing app, and keep up the good work. Have a great rest of your day/night."
"After having a long video edit deleted by imovie, in rage, I felt like giving this app a shot. And without a SHADOW OF DOUBT, this is 100x better than imovie! Not only is it actually EASY to use, it contains a 100x more features than ANY OTHER editing app I have seen. Yes, other apps do have more features, but NONE OF THEM HAVE THEM FREE like capcut! I have not seen one add since I started, haven’t spend a dime, and was able to create a video 100x better than when I had it in imovie! It even looks like video made from expensive editing apps! Download this app and ser it for yourself! And yes, I am a real person and this is a real review! Thank you Capcut❤️"
"I’ve had CapCut to make my edits for about a year now, with the splice part of overlay I learned how to make it glow and all but I have 1 problem, and it’s a big one. Capcut freezes in one spot if if it’s multiple overlays and key frames with those overlays it’s really annoying because I can’t see what my project looks like when the main parts of it are frozen? Although it does show up unfrozen when you export it, I want to see my project before I export it. (I’ve tried adjusting the frames to 60 and 20 that didn’t work and I tried reducing the quality again didn’t work) please fix this! It’s become annoying to edit when you only see a frozen screen and then it cuts back to the rest."
"so.. during my experience with this I’ve had little to no issues. the options are straightforward, and honestly I’d recommend this to a beginner. it doesn’t have a watermark, it has tons of free content, and it’s all-around enjoyable. the only complaint I have is when it comes to overlays. i wish we had the ability to have more overlay layers, which would make it easier to do tweening and things like that. I’ve been using this program for a good five months or so, and I wouldn’t go with anything else for basic videos and such. hope this review helped anyone looking to get this app."
"Would like to preface this by saying I love the app, but I think it could use a few things. Firstly, I would like it if you could add blending modes for the overlay function. That would be much easier than adding effects to my screenshots in ibis paint and then putting them in. Simple ones like add, multiply, screen, overlay, pin light, linear light, etc. I would also like to be able to muffle audios, as that could help me with what I make. Also, maybe being able to add multiple animation effects on the same screenshot? Mainly just the blending mode thing, I’m rlly begging for that one. 

Thanks to whoever made the app, I love your work, please consider my requests."
"I’ve been using CapCut forever now, and there is one problem that gets me very concerned and ANNOYED AS HECK: the storage issue. I’ve deleted ( like fully deleted.. like deleted them once they got moved to deleted pics) all of my photos, edits, and vids once, and IT STILL SAID I DIDNT HAVE ENOUGH STORAGE. ;-; I’ve become very aware of this and have deleted and re got the editing app to see if it worked or not, and it have never worked. I’m just hoping if there is any way you guys can fix this, I would rlly appreciate that. I would appreciate if there were more options in effects ( like more borders  ). I love this app, even more than Vita, but it’s just gotten a bit annoying! 😬"
"Using this app was amazing. For editing on a phone they really made everything pretty seamless with great quality and a wide range on tools. 
However, I needed to make some space on my phone and deleted the app to do so. Now that I am trying to re-download it keeps trying to download ""kingdom wars"" instead. 
I get a message ""you already own this app so no additional charge"" then ""download kingdom wars on wifi or cellular""? And the App itself never appears on my device.  
So it appears I can never use it again. 
Even if I let the game download, I come back and have no way of downloading the app itself."
I love CapCut a lot more than most editing apps because 1: no watermark! (Unless u don’t wanna remove it) 2: lots of good filters and other features. All in all it’s great (my storage isn’t the best right now and CapCut takes away a lot of it maybe you can do something to reduce storage take away? Also please add more overlays this is my fav editing app and I usually don’t add a lot of overlays to my videos but when I do it’s a pain to do all the work and then not be able to add them! Then I have to use mine aster which has a watermark and the editing it’s a bit harder since I learned on CapCut. Thank u for your time!!
"As a user of capcut for a while now I have come to see the pros and cons of this app. The transitions and animations are amazing as well as the options for text like animations. But the one thing I don’t like about capcut is the phone storage it takes up. Even though I clearly have enough space on my phone it still says I need to clear up more. My only Solutions are either deleting and reinstalling the app or restarting my phone. I hope this issue can be resolved in the future because this is really a great app. If this does get resolved in the future I would give it five stars. 
Thanks for reading my review,
      A fellow downloader"
This app is amazing. It gave me anything and everything I needed to edit my videos. Except for one minor bug. I wasn't allowed to edit in some categories like filters or some video effects. I looked up the solution and it turns out I need a VPN in order to fix it and I don’t really want to pay for it. That was a couple months ago and my oh my the issue has gotten way worse. It has gotten so worse that I can’t even edit transitions. And half of my edits I can’t even access as well. I don’t know if it’s a bug or if I’m doing something wrong. But please someone confirm or deny. Thank you for reading all of this.
"My rating on CapCut is very high. I use this app for literally everything! I love to use it to edit my tiktoks, or fun videos I make. The only thing I struggle a little bit with is the music. I have to use a voiceover just to get the music or sound I want!! Overall this app is super easy to use, and even right when I got it I already was growing so fast on learning how to edit. This app has helped me grow in editing in ways I never thought I could. The only thing I suggest is maybe adding some songs to add to your videos, or make it able to where we can put an id or something for the song we want! ❤️"
"I use this to make my edits, and when I put a Audio in, it’s fine at first and then I download it. But then it makes my edit low quality and blurry. And when I go back to look at the edit, it turns out that the audio messed up after I downloaded it. I shorten it down a little bit and the whole edit messes up! Also, maybe allow where you able to paste a link and then it puts in the audio for you? That’s all it needs.

Edit : somehow while editing I pasted my audio in and after a muted my other clip, the audio just stopped working and I couldn’t here anything. CapCut, please fix this 😟"
"Hi! I’ve been using capcut for about 2 months and it’s the best app ever! Everything is free, the templates are AMAZING! And, best of all it has audio velocity. + You can get rid of watermark which is just amazing. Some downgrades though 😭 wish I didn’t have to say this but my velocity disappeared for 2 days… it was super annoying I close the page a bunch and it didn’t work. So I deleted the app and that didn’t work either :( then the next day it was ok it came back. Slowly but surely I wish their were more effects and animations. Now looking back people put bad reviews just because they don’t search up how to do it HAHAHAHA🤣 but I honestly think you deserve to be the first. 

~Graphs~
Graphs are amazing! They need more work. When I use graphs I usually zoom out but idk 🤷‍♀️ if that’s how ur supposed to do that lol please give instructions yt tutorials are complicated and I can’t figure it out 🥲
Overall 5 stars!

"Lately, whenever I use the split tool for adding new clips or adding animations in them, towards the end of the clip, it shows a frozen frame of the previous clip at the very last second before moving on to the other one. It looks weird and very tightly cropped, and whenever I remove just only one millisecond of the previous clip, the frozen frame still shows up for like a split second. I don’t know if I could be the only one experiencing this, and it is kind of difficult to explain, but I did my best to explain the problem I’m having. Maybe it’s just me, though! But still a great app, nonetheless. 👍"
"I love this app when I had vita I wanted to be An editor but something with vita was just like wrong until I got CapCut I started to edit more and my edits started to get better, easier and faster :] but I definitely suggest this app it’s amazing it’s free and it has everything u need to edit u can customize ur text add sparkles add some cool/cute stickers and some effects also what’s cool is that to make the pics and videos look cool u can just click the pic/vid press animation and find a animation right that fits this app is not a scam! U can also green screen with it and everything I can’t say enough to say how cool this app is!"
"This app is absolutely phenomenal the transitions, the way you can speed and slow down things, the sound effects and the extracted audios is my favorite I absolutely adore this app please continue to make improvements on it. This app is flawlessly the best and cheapest way to edit your videos. Plus all of its free. Great app please continue to add more transition that’s my favorite because it actually looks stunningly designed with a dribble and drop and the blur effects. It’s all fantastically put together. Astonishing app keep it up and for the people reading this I encourage you to give it a try it’s absolutely amazing!"
"I’m telling u if u are making any sort of edit this is the best free app out there I’ve use all of them free and this is BY FAR the best one.  Although it does take a while if you want specific things like your text animated or putting text on a video this app is 100% free and pretty much the same( if not better) of the apps out there that you have to pay.  Don’t pay attention to the bad reviews this app is totally worth it.  Even if you don’t like it then u can just uninstall it :D.  Hope u found this helpful!!

(Also If you want to see how good this app edits then check out Survivorplayz on YT)!"
"While I love this app and its many features, it lacks an important one: merging layers. I used capcut for a documentary project and  added 5 different audios to a picture (all the audios were put as overlay). Of course when I needed to add a video before the picture, the audios overlapped on the video. It had a simple fix, really. Just merge the audios on the picture so when you manually move the picture, the audios are basically attached to it so they move too. However, this did not happen. So I could not put the video before the picture unless I manually moved up all the clips that came after the picture. That’s too much work considering I had 30+ small clips. Please add a merge feature."
"So I switched to this app when my old one started lagging, and it was 100% worth it. This app is just like my old one except, 1. there are no constant advertisements to make the app a better experience, 2. There is no water maker, and 3. You use chroma key to add some background. The only thing that this app was missing is some form of pivot points, this is essential for tweening anything, because this is not in the app you have to eyeball the rotations and hope for the best, other then that... I highly recommend this to anyone who want a easy and free way to animate with rigs on your iPad and/or iPhone.😁"
"I’ve had CapCut for almost a year now and I’ve got to say it’s one of the best editing apps out there, in my opinion. I’m just now writing a review because lately the app has been glitching and it’s never been like this before. When I try and export a video I look at the results and half of it is frozen- I have no idea why it’s doing that but I’m getting super frustrated with it. People keep telling me to I download the app the download it again but then all my edits I’ve ever done on that will be gone. So this goes mainly out to the CEO of CapCut please fix this soon! I really want to make more videos on your app!"
"My friends and a ton of people i follow that make edits use this app and when i got it i was at a friends house down the street and was starting my first edit, i was able to put all of the photos i needed in and time them right but when i went to add filters and animations it said there was no internet connection when i had full bars and full wifi, so i thought it was my phone being weird at my friends house and i would try at home. I got home and tried to keep working on the edit but again it didn’t let me access anything saying there was no connection, i tried multiple times to disconnect and reconnect my wifi but nothing works and because apple updated and won’t let you delete and redownload something my last hope is gonna and i cant finish my edit."
"One of them is when I add a video after the original video(s) I added, it tends to glitch, showing a weird green pattern over the screen. I can even reset the app, delete and re add the clip, or re download it, but it still happens. At one point I had to update my phone for 10-15 minutes in order to stop it from glitching. Also, a lot of times for the first split second of the clip, it will show a different part of the video that he part I cut out, so I have to split the clip in order to make it go away. Otherwise the app is great, if there was a pc version that would be even better."
"I’ve been on the search for a free video editor when I thought a found one. I’m not going to say the app out of respect but when I finished editing a WHOLE video, it said I had to pay to export it. After some time how ever I found CapCut. Long story short it had really good features like seamless transitions, chromakey and more! One thing I would like to see happen is more optimization for iPad like adding the tools more accessible and maybe if possible make the interface kind of like Final Cut Pro and more mechanical noises like pistons.

Other wise best free app. Would give a 4.8 so I’m rounding it to 5"
"Well, I been using this app since last year and I loved it! It’s amazing but there’s a problem about that I would like to explain so what I want to talk about is that i am very disappointed on why I can’t do velocity thing for me and my updates for Capcut are very slow so I do accept more of you for many reasons but I do believe that this app could be for good used for socials and more! And I am not going to say this is a terrible app! No no no no no!! This is a amazing app to edit things on the internet and immediately impressed people that you like and reply how you can improve on you own videos! And I love this for me! 💗💋💋 BYE!"
"Dude CapCut is just being so just HAUSJZUQSZJ and like I’m tryna edit but like it stops the video for like .7 seconds and i cant edit it right cause its doing that and i even deleted some stuff so that it would work but no- it decides not to work and i really need to edit a video! But idk why its like this, also whenever i make an edit, its in sync right? But when i export it it is completely out of sync and is like 3 seconds off… i mean ya CapCut is an amazing app, but its been like this for almost a whole entire month and it’s starting to get oh so very annoying! I mean, like CapCut is still amazing thats why i give it those 3 stars, but since that has been happening i will take 2 stars off."
"I used to do a lot of editing and it’s perfect for people who are looking for a simple app to improve their skills. It’s great for simple goofy things or some edits of a character or movie. There’s ton of effect and endless possibilities. I used to always be looking for a free editing app and I’m really grateful to have Stumbled across this one. There is tons of tutorials on how to do things and the effect can be very helpful. They are always coming out with viral effect that make your videos look professional or just brand new things that are still awesome! 
This is a awesome app! Pleaseeee download it! Have a nice day :))"
"I have been using this app for about 6 months now. It has been a great editing app and I used it for everything. But I have a problem. Every time I try to save a video to my phone it tells me that my storage is full on my phone. I have deleted tons of photos and a bunch of stuff and done all of the methods, even cleared the cache and almost all of my projects/drafts, but it still will not let me save a video. I even tried resetting my phone multiple times after the methods. This all started when I tried to save a 24 minute video and I shortened the video up to 8 minutes but it still will not let me save any of my projects. I really need help. Do you have any suggestions?"
"So I had really really fun times with this app I edited with it and did almost every edit with it so won day I updated my computer and iPad and then I forgot about this and when I remembered the whole thing was different I didn’t know how to do things so basically it kept getting worst until won day I did to effects and then I kept adding and it kept freezing and kicking me out I did another update and it was the same so please stop it from doing this other then that stuff it’s a great app and I will keep using it even tho I have to upload alotttttttttt
Friday, November 13 🖤"
"CapCut is pretty much the best app because no watermark and you can have multiple layers but I had this app for like 2-3weeks and when I go and see my like anime edits it says “install now” and don’t get me wrong! But it dose this to all of my edits even my old edits and it kinda got annoying cuz it did every 0ne of my edits.
But I might be just me that experienced this because I kinda have a lot of photos- and I’m not saying that this is a bad app it’s just the only thing annoying me but out of that problem this is the best app I ever downloaded or installed!.😁 

Oh and this happens like now in August or in September~"
"I love using CapCut but still find it annoying at times. When I make edits, it usually lags and don’t get to see what it looks like while editing. Usually when I export it, it looks fine but I don’t want to make an hour long video for it to look bad. I don’t mean for this to come off as hate because with isnt, but it definitely could make me happy for it to not lag! 

Now, if you think I’m being to greedy with the app, I probably am! You can’t make a game to stop lagging, it’s going to lag no matter what. It might’ve my phone, or the app itself. Idk so if it is the game, please help, if not, sorry for wasting your time :)"
"I’m going to be honest, I LOVE THIS APP!! I use it all the time when I’m editing but I think this might just be me. Whenever I cut one of the slides down to be smaller ( shorten the duration of the photo) it’ll always glitch and skip past some of the photos, it’s extremely annoying and hard to work with. Also some of the pictures won’t show and it’ll just stay on the first picture you inserted. Like I said this might just be me but it’s annoying and makes it hard to edit. If you can fix this I’d be very happy, thanks!"
"Well I do use CapCut to edit mostly all of my edits, but I really wish there was a option to change the pitch and not just slow down the music we imported or picked from the app. It would be extremely helpful if there was a option to change the pitch because then we could adjust how low the sound can get or how high. Even though you guys have a option to slow down the music which kinda makes the pitch deep it makes the sound super long and hard to edit. I really like the app and I will most definitely keep using it but if there was a pitch option it would be really really helpful. Thank you."
"Overall everything works pretty alright and you can do some decent short video editing, lots of settings to mess with and change but not overwhelming. Lost a star due to the lack of communication with users. For the reader’s reference: The auto velocity button was removed with no explanation and I had to find out that they were working on it through a comment Capcut made on tiktok. I shouldn't really have to say this but if there is a major bug, alert the users. Also potentially add custom zoom animations and maybe some more 3d styles.                                        If you read this far here you go 👉👑"
I love it! My favorite thing is that they don’t have any watermarks! But I would like that you would save my songs when I am done using them and can you like make it like a video when your done with the video? Because it takes a bit too much space on my iPad/ iPhone I love it because you don’t need internet to use it! Effects are amazing! Can you add a bit more things? I would like new features like you can do a mirror like double videos next to each other and like you can notify me for new features to keep up? I love this editing app! Easy and free! I love it so much! <3
"This is a great app and all, but I want to be able to add music from my files. I'm trying to make an intro for yt, and I was finding some songs to use for my intro. I recorded some songs, and put them in my file, and when I got on this app, I added a picture, to see how this app actually works, and some options. (I just got this app.) and I clicked the add music button, and I didn't see an option to add music from my file, and I got sad.. so, can you please add a feature to be able to add music from a file? Thanks if you do so! Right now, I'll just use iMovie to add the music."
"I’ve had slit of editing apps and a lot of them needed you to spend a lot of money so I gave up. Then I found this app im still working on getting better with editing but there are so many options and cool effects that you can use. Would very much recommend this app to use while there are still some other professional editing apps this one is perfect for me and slot of my kids use this to make edits and post videos. I love how there aren’t really any ads, you can just edit without being interrupted while there may be a few it isn’t over loaded with ads unlike some games."
"(I’m only giving 5 starts because it’s a good app but I’m just experiencing an issue)
 Issue ⬇️
So basically out of now where I wanted to make a edit but I couldn’t use effects for some reason and it said that there was no Internet connection so I was checking my Internet I was connected to Internet I have LTE I tried restarting my phone still does the same thing said I had no Internet then I even deleted the app and download it again and it still said the exact thing please let me know if there is anything I can do."
I used CapCut it was really easy to use  and it was just a few things were hard for me and I got really on my nerves but it was really good I was kinda not good at it then I go I said before  my phone may or may not been thrown across the room but yeah I made a really good your edits on it proud of them very proud of them but I did use shortcut I did not know about it but this was probably a stupid review but anyway I just wanna say that cupcake was amazing and I really hope y’all download it and enjoy how you make your edits I won’t talk anymore have a good rest of your day or night
Hi I’m writing this to show my appreciation towards this app. Editing has quickly become one of my fav things to do and CapCut makes it easy. I love how I can do so much for free and how great everything about it is. However I do have a slight complaint. I notice that anytime I copy a clip and make it an overlay and add graphs the clip glitches and I am unable to do anything however if I remove the graphs the clip is fine. This hasn’t been an issue until recently so I’m hoping it’s just some bug you guys could fix. But it is really bothering me. That’s just what I wanted to share. All in all though I love this app I use it everyday. Thank you so much
Ok so like I said its amazing overall but it would be easier if you had put in like one photo if you could divide it into equal new photos:Explanation is if I had a screenshot of my gacha character that i wanted more screenshots of but I didn't want to put the same pic OVER AND OVER AGAIN I could click the divide button and press a button of how many screenshots I wanted and bam there you have it! If this is not possible the whole reason I requested this is so you can have more than one animation in one photo thing/video. Otherwise great app 5 stars!
"I love capcut omg! i recommend it to all my friends. its a good app and there is a bunch of cool effects and features at your fingertips! not to mention it is super easy to navigate, unlike most other apps. however, it has been extremely laggy lately? i got capcut around a year ago, obviously there were less features, but there was also less lag. personally, i like to make edits of me and my friends. im also a youtuber, and the lag makes videos 2 minutes or longer hard to edit. overall, capcut is amazing, and i still recommend it to everyone, but i would love it so much more if it was less laggy. <3"
"i love capcut! i’m a pro capcut editor so i know how to get around some stiff transitions. but i’ve been kinda tired of wasting my own storage, and a while ago graphs were added to capcut (by far my favorite update!), and now one more thing is missing to make the app more like video star and alight motion: tiles/mirroring, turbulence, velocity, skews, and really just all the things that video star and alight motion have (even funimate!). i’d do anything to get those and make a transition with them and graphs. so i’m begging you capcut, in your future updates, add them! capcut’s format is way easier to learn and use than any other editing app. i bet me and a ton of other people would be able to learn how to use all the things i just listed way faster on capcut than any other app. you could even make it cost money to get those! i’d pay for it! other than that, capcut is an awesome app for beginners and even pro editors!"
"I started using this app a day ago, and I found it really easy! I really like the effects, and the transitions. I’m also glad you don’t have to pay for these effects, and other things. But when you edit the pictures, and go to combo. It gives you a certain amount of duration until it just stops moving. When it stops moving it’s around 0.6-0.7 duration, until it stops just on the picture. I find that...kinda annoying to be honest. And it would be very kind of you to fix that! I’m not that good at explaining things, but I hope you can understand! Definitely recommend it tho!!"
"I was scrolling through Tik tok too see some beautiful edits, and I came across a wholesome Anime edit. I really wanted to know the program the creator used to make the edit, and I saw the comments were like— “This person is using capcut lololol”, but i didn’t let that get in my way. Honestly, i thought to myself, “This app must be really high rated and pretty neat”. So, A while later I downloaded it- And honestly, I have no self doubts about this app, this is just honestly beautiful. The transitions, effects, everything. If I’d have the ability to rate this to a 100, I would, because honestly- I love it! ❤️"
"I absolutely LOVE the app it has to be one of the best editing apps! It has so many options and even has stickers that are a trend around the world! The animations (my favorite part about the app) are what make the app so special. Just one thing.. when I use the text bar for the lyrical edits there's not so many animation options, I'd like the text animation to be as good as the animations for the clips! If you would be able to do that the videos would be extra beautiful!! But overall, I would rate this 5 stars because it is as I stated above, one of the best editing apps! 😊"
"I was working on a basketball edit last night and didn’t finish. I was planning on finishing today, but whenever I click on the video, it says, “Couldn’t update. Try again later.” It says to check network settings and my Wi-Fi is full. Then it says, “If you failed after multiple attempts, save project and wait for version update. However, the update was today. I can’t watch or edit any of my videos. It really pisses me off, too. This app would be a 5-star. Usually this problem is quick to solve. I just refresh the app and it works. But it doesn’t work now."
"Overall, it’s a very good editing app. It’s a very good app for beginners. But today, I was editing a video and I was looking for the “Style” button. I and was so confused about where it was. I was gonna make an edit with one of the things in the style option. So then I thought, “Oh it’s probably a glitch. I will just delete my tabs.” But, when I did the style option wasn’t there. So then I was looking through TikTok and etc. and I found out it was removed. My only problem/request is, bring the style option back!"
"I’ve been using CapCut for over a year now and I love it! I make edits constantly with it; it’s easy to use and user friendly. Although there are some cons to it. For example: I can’t combine a loop effects with “in” and “out” transitions. In my opinion, they should be two separate things that can be combined. There’s some more problems I have with it, but they’re not too important, and personally it’s just things that I somehow figure out at some point 😂
Other than that though, this app is utterly amazing and I love it! I recommend it for most of my friends that look into editing, and most of them typically like it!"
"I’ve used A LOT of different editing apps, Filmora, KineMaster, IMovie, VideoStar, AlightMotion, but not get near CapCut. First, when FREE there is no watermark. Second it has multiple layers, again FOR FREE, which is rare now. It’s free in filters and transitions make it look like your a professional video editor. 

My only request, which is more of a suggestion than a complaint, is that we should be able to search for transitions and filters and animations because sometimes it gets tedious scrolling through all the options. 

Otherwise, amazing app, and you should download!"
"So this app is amazing for my edits and I use it all the time but there is something I would like to address. First of all, the animations and transitions and a little corny so it makes my edit look like Vinkle which is not a good thing. And lastly, when you drag the cursor so that you can go to one place of the video to the other, there is no sound. I would like sound because if there is a beat in the video, I need to get it perfectly so it looks good when the video splits. Anyways, the app is amazing but I would really like for these problems fixed. Thanks!"
"If your looking for a really good and free (without ads) editing app, this is for you! Everything is super easy to use and everything is 100% free. You can make edits or just photoshop pictures. There are so many things you can do on this app. My favorite part is the video editing. I can add more videos, delete old one and even add my own songs. I personally use it to do character edits with different tools like the effect tool which really helps if you can a super cool but easy look to go for. I love this app so much more than video star or splice! It works like magic!"
Ok I honestly never leave reviews on anything because I’m just lazy but i had too for this! It’s honestly the best editing app I’ve truly used paying for and being free. You get so many features and it’s so easy too work with once you get the hang of it!! You find out all these little features throughout the way and it’s just overall awesome! It does kick you off randomly sometimes but it’s not like often and it’s when like too much is happening which is understandable as other apps do that as well! But overall just an awesome app and would def recommend :))
"Now, I like making gacha videos for fun. Lately, I’ve been looking for and editing app that’s simple to use, and I don’t have to pay to remove a watermark. CapCut covered both of these! It has the simplicity of cute cut, but with more features and no watermark! Ideal editing app, right? Yeah, for only one freaking day. I literally got this app YESTERDAY, and it worked perfectly for the first couple hours. I was very happy, because I thought I found my permanent editing app. Now, It constantly freezes, and so I can’t get anything done! Even when I restart the project, it. Still. Freezes. From opening the app to actually making the video, it just freezes and “lags” SO much....."
"capcut worked good for me for so long but then I recently got issues. So my wifi is fine, I have storage, and my sisters cap cut works fine we got our new iPads the same day. Whenever I open it everything says no internet connection it never did that before even if reinstall the app or delete sm stuff it still does that. Please fix this. Also my phone doesn’t have this issues. My bff is having issues too. When she opened it, it was just a black screen now that she reopened it sm it finally stopped, but her volume isn’t working, her camera roll shows the audio but you can’t hear it and the button to click audio on or off is on plus the volume was 100. She reset her device sm and reinstalled plus reopened it and still no. Fix your apps glitches pls."
"I’m  shook. Just- this app is amazing, nothing bad; just beautiful. Like it’s easy to use, glad you
Can use TikTok audios, and no lag- like the transition affects are also just ✨mwah✨ It’s easy to use and it’s amazing. It just seems so professional and it’s so good!! The animation is beautiful, so underrated and it’s just SOOO SMOOTH!!!  It’s not hard, it’s easy, and just overall so good. Like the motion blur is just ✨yes✨ And it’s beautiful, you have key frames, animation, THE GRAPHS TOO!!! ART!! I ALSO LOVE HOW YOU CAN REMOVE THE WATERMARK AT THE END    that’s all but my point is this is definitely a recommended app 💕 5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
"I would definitely recommend this app to any mobile editors who want to take it to the next level while still maintaining simple and easy use. 

This app allows you to do some pretty crazy stuff, there are so many different filters and many other editing tools, and my favorite is the 3d effect where it will literally separate you (or the object you are recording) from the background and add a 3d motion... absolutely awesome!

Again, how do you consider yourself a mobile editor if you dont have this app??"
"I have easy things about it it’s great and easy, but i need to let you know about these things
So could you please add a ghost pop out effect where your characters ghost pops out not like a ghost but a pop out a effect so we don’t have to crop the same video and make it like a pop out effect
Next can you make black flashing and moving camera shaking (not shaking and stuff I mean like a moving camera around.
And like slow motion Effect where at one part of the video you can choose it to where you can make it slow down or reverse."
"This app is overall pretty good. Better then KineMaster even. But the two problems I have with it are, there’s no zoom in feature like KineMaster has. Second of all. I’m trying to make a gacha video but every time I try to add text it kicks me out. And when I try to review my progress it stays on the last screenshot I put. it’s getting ridiculous because I have a time limit and Need to get this video out today. Please fix this so others don’t have to go insane trying to make a simple minute long video with text

edit: now that I updated it it’s the entire video now that’s every time I log into the video it kicks me out the entire app"
So I LOVE this app. It helps me make anime edits I like or for friends. I make Gacha mini movies here. I also do some for holidays or to remind someone there special. But it won’t let me import a lot of pictures lately not even 8! So I’m concerned if there is a bug or something I checked on safari it said I may have too much storage I deleted some storage but it won’t work! Is or bc I have an iPad? NO! Before on my IPAD it would let me put sooooo much pictures what’s up with that. Well whatever. But yes this app is great. So I do recommend it for all you editors especially pros. So you should download it all of you amazing editors.
"I love this app mainly because it’s free. Also, it’s almost like VideoStar and Funimate, but it takes a little bit more time. When you use this app for like a few months, you’ll get better and your edits will look better! Also, they have some good effects and always adds new animation for videos, and sometimes when I show someone the edit I did, nobody knows that it was CapCut and assumed I was using VideoStar! But, CapCut is like a starter editor, but very good too. I think you should use CapCut, then VideoStar, and then After Effects for editing. Overall, very good app!"
"okay so i love capcut and have been able to do some amazing things with it. but there’s just one thing i would love, and then it would be perfect. could you guys please add smooth slomos? they look really choppy and bad currently, and i have to use other apps to add the slomos. it’s fine, but it would just be so much easier if capcut itself had them. also, it would be super helpful if you could add a option where you can add multiple transitions in one clip. example, maybe you can put up to 3/5 on each clip. that would be so cool. but overall, i love capcut a lot and it’s helped me. thank you! 

-Vivi"
I love CapCut you can do so many awesome and creative things but all the Roblox YouTuber are talking about the amazing update but for 3 days I tried deleting CapCut and getting it back .And I also updated it but there is still no difference to CapCut.I really wanted to try masking and the new effects but I only have one new effect that is is the colorful frame one which keeps on despairing . I really don’t know why this was happening or how long I have to wait for CapCut to give me the update but either way it’s a great editing app with the update or without it.
i have a quick question can you please make a new update were all my videos and photos i make on this app does not Erase when i transfer all my data to another phone. because my old phone had this app and when i transfer it to my brand new phone i lost all my edits/videos and photos that i made on this app so yeah it will be cool if you made a quick small update where you can transfer all my videos photos and edits so i don't lose all my progress of remaking that again. thank you for reading as well have a nice day
"This is is the best editing app ever!! When I made my first ever edit, it was so easy! There was transitions, effects, and other things! Other apps like InShot don’t do any well. But there are A lot of trends in the internet, and some of them, you have to use other apps for them. MORE APPS-Maybe you guys can create a new app, for example capcut-roblox editor, capcut- Gacha editor. EFFECTS,other things-
So, we basically have some trouble when we are editing, for example, you could add velocity’s, flashing videos, and more.
Hope this message helps you improve stuff!!!"
"Ok I am in love with this app! It the best editing app I’ve ever had! CapCut has a lot of effects,audios,transitions,and its for free! This is an amazing app! But something happened today that I’m really mad about. Like most people I do Gacha and I use the Gacha screenshots on CapCut. Since I don’t want my whole photo gallery filled with those images I hide them as. On CapCut it would let me still use hidden photos and I was SOOO happy about that! But today it won’t let me use any hidden photos and it’s not even an option anymore! So now I can’t make my edit and I was really sad about that. I was going to make a special edit but now I can’t :/"
I have been using this app for about a year now I have learned a lot of things using it and have seen my editing skills improve if you need something easy to use I recommend this also this is perfect for beginners and pros you can really make some great things. Now for things I hope to see if you could add a community section we’re people can show off there creations and share tutorials that would be great I would love to rate this a 100/5 but it won’t let :) big props to the workers of CapCut and to the people KEEP EDITING YOU CAN GET REALLY GOOD
"I am currently using Cap cut to edit yt videos and so is my friend! It works amazing!! There is no watermark, and you dont have to pay for anything! I have had a great experience with it so far, I would recommend it to anyone who is not looking to pay for anything but still be able to edit good videos without a watermark. There is a bit of a problem with the volume adjusting though. You might have to adjust the volume a lot if you want to make the volume change a little bit. But otherwise great app and I would totally recommend.😄"
"This app, is a LIFESAVER.
I was trying to learn how to make simple edits of pictures and videos, adding animations in the beginning and such to make it look cool. I tried multiple apps such as Video Star and Alight Motion. They were both VERY confusing and overwhelming and I couldn’t figure out how to use them. CapCut is very well laid out and easy to use. The controls are a good size and I can figure out how to add animations SO easily. I opened the app and in under 5 minutes I already have a awesome video. There is NO watermark and that’s so awesome. This app is AMAZING!!!!! 😝 
-A very satisfied 11 year old."
"Recently I was editing with this app, and I've come across a really bad glitch! Whenever you use Graphs, it resets chroma key and it glitches the animation to another part of the screen (for me it glitched only to the left of the screen). It ruined lots of my edits and really stressed me out. I have no clue if this is happening to anyone else, but I know that it is happening to me and it's really annoying. I would love it if you fixed this glitch and make your supporters proud! You've come a long way and I hope no glitch stops your journey."
"I have needed a great app for a while that is not only a great way to upgrade and create videos but is also easy for beginners like me who may I have weak editing skills! CapCut makes it all like easy. Even though I may not be the best at editing videos, CapCut made my edits and videos look right out of a movie! I can’t recommend this app enough to people who are looking for something easy to work with! 5/5 for you! There is nothing I’d change! The only thing it could use is some add ons but it’s really amazing already! Thanks for reading this! -Fellow User"
"This app provides so many effects, length, and etc! I am so glad I found out what CapCut is because if I never found out what is was, I would be depressed!😅 here are so pros and cons of CapCut!

𝖯𝗋𝗈𝗌😎:
- It has TONS of effects/frames to use.
-It is easy to learn, barely confusing!
-Has amazing quality when you export it!!
-When you export the video, it doesn’t take as long, and the export thing updated amazingly!
-When you import photos/videos, they can imported more then 100 times! (It’s just a saying I don’t know if it can😅)

𝖬𝗈𝗏𝗂𝗇𝗀 𝗈𝗇... 𝖼𝗈𝗇𝗌😞

𝖢𝗈𝗇𝗌😮:
-It is very laggy when you add to much splits. (I understand that happens)
-When you cut the video to short, it’s hard to press on and it takes you to the transition part. (I hate that the most)

𝖤𝗇𝖽𝗂𝗇𝗀😋:

Thank you so much for making this app! It’s is very useful and helpful. I just really hope you see this review and fix some of my problems! ✨☺️"
"Hey! I love this app and I use it for my roblox tiktoks because I’m on mobile. I have some suggestions for the next update. Maybe we could have some way to make sure videos and screen records stay the same quality throughout or some way to enhance quality without the beauty filter. Also, could we possibly be able to adjust the affects to our liking so that we can customize however me want? I feel as though I use the same presets all the time and can’t customize them to my liking. Please use my suggestions for a future update?"
"Even though it says you have to be a pro or something. I love that it doesn’t have watermark! And you don’t have to pay to remove it! And I love that you can remove the ending if you don’t want people to know it’s capcut! It’s great for making edits because you don’t need to pay to use cool stickers/effects or transitions (only a few you need to pay)! It’s such a fun app! And I also enjoy how you can screen record a sound and then place it into the upload video file and it’s just used as a sound! It’s a great app! And I definitely recommend!

-Upside Of Nat YT"
Honestly we’re do I even start this is probably one of the best and incredible editing apps to exist when I first got this app I thought it was going to be like those other apps you have to pay for and use the lame transitions but no this was is FREE I’m very grateful that this app exist after using this free app for months I be came a master and doing edits everything is free comes with so many things LITERALLY!!! and I haven’t stoped using it I really recommend this app everything was fine when I got it I have no problems using the stuff they have on the app ITS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!🥰❤️
"I have been using capcut for at least a year now, the way i can make extremely smooth velocities are amazing! But, The quality is a little off because when i crop the video/photo, The quality is mostly ruined and the sharpen doesn't help, I wish we would add tiles for the graphs because its kind of annoying having a black space behind the photos, Any motion blur on graphs or effects would be better so the edit doesn't look raw. Overall, I highly recommend this app for editing!"
"I use CapCut for almost every video I make! It’s amazing, would recommend, but I have one suggestion. So you know when your adding photos in to make the video, I wish there would also be this feature where you can just slide your finger and it would select the pictures you want faster, like the app photos, when you want to select something on their you can just slide your finger. It would be cool to have that feature, I hope you think about considering about the suggestion!"
I love this editing app it’s better than a video star you don’t have to pay for anything and you can even get rid of the watermark but I have some suggestions for the animation we should be able to make our own kind a like a video star because it would be better to learn how to make your own transitions instead of using presets for the keyframes we should be able to click on the little diamond thing and we should make it like a transition type thing but other than that this is a good editing app
IT JUST GETS worse it’s like you guys are trying to fix it but giving it more glitches I’ll be trying to tween on it and it’ll make whatever I’m using go across the screen for no reason and it’ll just start flying around even when it’s not playing and I can’t even use that happen anymore because it’s so broken like what do I need to to to get it to not break every time I open the freaking app my friend goes into it it says that all her photos are private and that she cannot use them to the app because they were all private even though 15 times she made it we’re saying could use all her photos mine just breaks all the time I hate this stupid app to the dumb humans who ““ fix the bugs you’re just making them worse
"CapCut is an amazing app, don’t get me wrong! Amazing effects, animations, etc! And this app is really SIMPLE and EASY to use! I was a beginner, I had trouble at first, but then I explored the app so much I mastered it! Really, it’s just smack down awesome.! But I do have some things I suggest. Now that I use this app daily to do Roblox edits, it keep on lagging! Like, I can’t even get through an app that lag a whole lot! So please fix that. And I would like for y’all to add more Text animations, because all the animations are quite boring! But that’s all the issues! And the lagging is getting on my last nerve so. But please fix that but yeah I do love it bye!"
"I’ve been looking for a video editing app for iPad Pro, as imovie was not cutting it. I LOVE the background removal tool, and that you can import GIFs with transparent backgrounds. That’s why I got this app in the first place! Great interface, simple and intuitive to use, takes advantage of the ipad (rather than feeling like a desktop app just plopped into ipad or downgraded for ios). 

However…a couple functions would make things exponentially easier for building longer experimental video art.
1. being able to cut/copy + paste into another capcut project (and anywhere in the current project, as it’s basically just a duplication function rn—to be able to work on smaller clips and then move around 
2. similarly, perhaps just being able to merge two projects 
3. the ability to pin overlays and maintracks so that when you move things around / delete sections, the overlays stay put 

Overall, love, and looking forward to updates!!"
"I love CapCut it’s a great mobile editor and doesn’t take up as much storage as most editing apps do. I use cap cut for all my videos! It’s so easy to use and has everything a beginner or intermediate editor needs. I love how customizable it is too! From the text to the music you can have any vibe you want! 
  The only complaint I have is that you can’t do certain things without having WiFi like adding stickers and music. But otherwise this is an awesome app and I will probably use it for awhile. 👏👏👏👏 thank you for making capcut!"
"When I first downloaded the app, it was really great and it still is, but as i got into editing with it and making more complicated videos, I realized that once you add text to a clip, you can’t get edit the clip without the text moving. This is useful sometimes, but it would be nice to have a switch to turn it off.

I spent a long time editing the text before making the video. When i was finished with the text, i realized that I wouldn’t be able to even make the video without starting over. Instead of 30 minutes, it took me and hour."
"Recently i started to get into editing. Nothing big and fancy just cool little edits and stuff like that. I watched videos and tried several different apps but nothing like this. The fact that this app is free is awesome! There are so many features and like i said before its all free. This app allows you to even cut out the ending (its promo) unlike most apps. I definitely recommend this app to people like me who do little edits people who make tiktoks and maybe want some cool effects, for IG stories and all of the above. Give it a try."
"I believe that the heavens have brought us a god level app. for an app to be free, with removable watermarks *for free* and to have all of the features to make anime edits 10x faster and better *for free* It's no surprise that it's gonna have adds.
If you want this app, take the adds like a champ, unless you have an add-blocker. This app saved me years because to make this level of edits, I would have to buy a computer, learn how to use the expensive editing softwares, and make my own effects. The level of impressiveness here just simply hurts it so amazing. oo/5 would pay money for"
"ITS AMAZING! Trust me, it’s very easy. There are great music INSIDE the app and easy to put in, so you don’t have to screen record and all that stuff. Your progress ACTUALLY SAVES and I’ve never had a time where it lost any progress at all. I literally just began editing and I’m already making better edits than experienced editors (with different edit apps). It’s 100% free and has NO WATERMARK!!! You may be thinking, “No way, that’s too good to be true” but it’s not. I promise you, when you download this wonderful app, you will NEVER have any regrets."
"CapCut is one of the best apps I used for editing, and it’s easy too!! But I have some ideas about it to maybe improve it! You should add this thing where you can post your edits so other people can see it, and like it! And also that you can see other people’s edits too! And don’t forget a thing where you can use the sound there using for the edit! Although CapCut is an amazing app! No adds, it lags on me but only when I do an edit that includes a lot of pictures! But it came out perfect! This app is definitely not a scam and is worth it!!"
"Recently after the update it refuses to let me use certain effects (specifically the bling ones) but all of the other ones will load.
Basically what will happen is that it will say I ""don't have internet"", I literally reinstalled the app, lost everything, and its still saying this. At this point it has nothing to do with my internet for that reason. What does this mean? Is it a bug? Im really confused. 
Hopefully it'll be fixed in the next update bc I was making a really good edit but once I went to add effects I got angry because of the fact nothing works no matter what you do..."
So when I got CapCut it was working wonderfully for me but then every time now it lags and crashes so much and it’s not my WiFi because my WiFi is good hen I use other apps but then when I use CapCut it crashes and lags and it’s starting to annoy me may you check it out and when I do the insanity in the chroma key it does not work it keeps going to 0 never mind I made a mistake the chroma key is working and when I see how I edited without the full screen thing it won’t work I have to get out of CapCut and go back in
"I love this app it is so fun and easy to make all the edits! But a couple things, I’m a person who suffers from iPhone storage and CapCut takes up a lot of space!!!! Ivan never make edits because I don’t have enough I phone storage and I’ve tried everything I can!! I’ve deleted photos, apps, files, and downloads but nothing works! I’ll be making an edit and I’ll go eat lunch and when I go back on the app I can’t make it anymore! I’m not saying this app isn’t  great it’s AMAZING but those are somethings to consider if you suffer from iPhone storage like me"
"Ok so capcut is the best editing app I have seen so far and trust me I have tried MANY apps! But I do have some suggestions to make it easier to use. The first one is searching, like you could search a sticker or and effect. The second one is I wish you could use it on computer. the third one is I wish that the text would move with the screen, like when I put an animation on and then the text it just looks weird. But besides all of that it is an amazing app and would totally recommend!"
"ok so, i would give it a 4/5 or maybe even a 5/5 but, the app is VERY. VERY. VERY, weird, it kicks me out of the app. I don’t lose any of my progress, It’s just VERY annoying. And also, sometime i can’t change how long i want the photo to be. No effects on it or anything and i can’t control the photo. Then i have to start all over again, and then i do lose all my progress. And even if i go back to the beginning of the edit to see how it is so far, it just is stuck with the photo that I had just edited. So all i see is that one photo and the audio, then i have to delete the edit and start over again. Please try and fix this. Thank you 🙂 <3"
"This app is amazing, BUT minor details keep it from being the BEST. Make it where we can edit the effects plus some effects loop “make all effects a Continues flow” we might want it longer the 5 seconds plus I want to stack my effects and make certain effects dominate over other effects. “Layers” Maybe I want 2 or more effects at one time ect. We need more options when exporting. I definitely love this app and I definitely have a few other ideas that could make it flawless. But can’t remember right now. I will definitely use it more and update my review."
"So I use this app to edit my videos on YT and I have some suggestions 
For the first one can you add a search bar when you can’t find the thing that your looking for
For the second one can you add 2 new screen affects like smear and circle smear(for circle smear the center isn’t smeared but the outside of it is)
For the third can you please add text animations like the photo animations with the in, out, and combo so that it’s easier to make a text move with the photo
That’s all I have for suggestions overall I really like this app😊👍"
"I have NEVER found a video app that works so well and has. so many different components. Before CapCut, I had to use a bunch of different apps to get all the effects I wanted, and there was always some annoying problem I ran into in each app. (in addition to that, after being processed through multiple apps, the finished product was always very blurry) Now, with CapCut, it literally has every single thing I could ever want and it is so easy to understand and use that I could never ask for anything better."
"I know this is a good editing app! I see people edit with it all the time and the results are always amazing. I do have a slight problem (not sure if it’s just my phone) but I could have perfect wifi and it says I don’t have a connection. I don’t know if anyone else has this problem, but it just makes it difficult, because you can’t add effects, edit the text (fonts, style, etc.) I know it’s sort of a 
my-phone problem, because I didn’t really see many of the reviews saying this, but just wanted to put this out there in case anyone else has this problem. Overall, it’s an amazing app!"
I love this app it’s really easy to use when I’m editing something or I just need to make a video and add the effects on another app but I recommend that that you fix the bug where when you put a picture and then you put your sound or song up there And the you try to pick another picture and it’s you have no pictures up that you have to exit out the app fully and then go back on it I recommend you fix that and the blue box on the stuff that’s all I have to say but rn I love this app!!
"It’s a great app for beginning editors but one thing is that I hope they could add a feature where you can upload videos in at least 1440p 30frames or 60frames because it compresses the video and therefore it comes out pixilated and not very pleasing, and how I hope they would develop 1440p upload is when you download the video to your camera roll the coding in the app would find that video on the internet and find the video that matches it and takes that 1440p video and matches with the one your moving to your camera roll"
When I downloaded capcut (I still have it) I accepted the terms of service and the private policy and when I wanted to make a edit it tells me that I need to go to settings to accept to save my edits so I press it and I see no capcut on it only roblox and my other apps so I try to search it up and it’s still not there and I tried editing and It still didn’t work I even uninstalled capcut and reinstalled it back and refreshed the app and it still didn’t work so can you please fix this I think it only works on a IPhone but I’m using a iPad so again can you please fix it
So at first this app was rlly good and I was having fun with editing but then after a few weeks it started saying “insufficient storage. Clean up some phone storage and try again.” So it wasn’t a big deal at first and I deleted a few pictures an everything was good but then a few days go by and it happens again and i deleted a few pictures again and it kept saying that and even if it lets me in my edit I cant save it? And my storage isn’t even full it’s not even half way through which makes no sense and it has rlly been annoying me
"ah yes, the most used editing app used in a LOT of places!! <3 capcut is so good and has creative transitions! theres effects, and all that stuff! you can also make custom transitions with a little help with effects! anyways, i have a little problem,... or just a question. when i try and create a project: it says i need to give access but when i go to settings i cant find the camera or album saving in the options. please respond asap because i’d just like to know and understand!"
"I loved using this app when I began editing, now that im more advanced I would definitely recommend this app for editing! Its super easy to use and you can always end up with something pretty good! But there is a really bad glitch. It always says i have no internet and wont let me add animations are style my text. I have made sure to update the app. I also do have internet! But recently its just hasn’t been working! I do hope you can fix it, or have any suggestions on helping the glitch go away! But otherwise pretty decent app!"
"Really good for edits and it has lots of built in effects. My favorite effects come from the party tab and the retro tab because they fit my edit style. One day there should be an option to create your own transitions which would open a lot of creativity for users. The only problem that i have with the app is that when you lower the volume, it doesn’t lower much but cap cut is an amazing app that always gets better, they update and add new features and bug fixes nearly monthly i would 100 percent recommend :)"
"I first thought it would be an editing app where you have to pay for everything, but no! It’s all free and there’s great stuff too! It has better and more useful tools than other editing apps, and a lot of music choices. I love it. It can take a little to load when there is more images, so that’s one thing. But it also saves by itself, which can be very helpful. It has a few other tiny problems that could be fixed, but not too big of a deal. Overall, it’s a great app and definitely a 5 star rating."
"I’ve used this app in the past to make a lot of edits, but recently every time I make an edit, when I add a 5th or 6th clip it freezes for like 10 seconds and turns off the 30 seconds of the audio. and it’s not like it only happened once, I tried to make another one and it froze at the same time and place. idk if it’s a problem on only my side but I heard a lot of other ppl say it made their edits glitchy too. and it’s not even like this app is bad, it’s really easy to use in my opinion and I love using it but these glitches recently have started happening."
"When I first started using CapCut, I had just started editing. CapCut is very user friendly and I was ably to learn very quickly. One of the best things about it is that all of the features are free and decently made. My only complaint is they don’t have some more basic trending effects such as hue shift and light scan aren’t available on the app. Custom masking also isn’t currently an option. Overall, I think CapCut is a great app for beginner editors to experiment with and is slowly becoming better and better for more advanced editors."
"OK, so this app honestly is really good and it has a lot of filters, effects, and transitions I like. However, my suggestion would be to add an option to lower the opacity of the effects. Some of the effects I love, but they are too bright. So I would like a lower opacity option for the effects. Honestly, this app is great but with a few updates/changes, this app could be a 5 star! Thank you for reading, and developers, if you are reading this. I think your app is great, just add some changes and I might change my review. Have a good morning/afternoon/night! 🌹"
"This app is amazing and you can do many things with how simple it is. I’ve been using the app for awhile now and the more I use it the more advanced things I figure out to do, but I feel so I’ve reached the end of this apps potential. One thing I am confused about is that I can’t copy a clip as an overlay, as the option is not highlighted. If I were to get this fixed I would be able to do sooooo much more with the app. I find myself doing the same thing over and over again, but if this problem was fixed I would be able to have so much more fun with the app."
"Review:
CapCut is the best free editor for beginners who are learning how to edit!..- although if you’re more experienced with editing, you might want to move on to a more complex app/software. CapCut is more of the easy side of editing, with fewer options and effects.. which is why I would like to ask if CapCut would consider adding more complex effects. 

Recommendations:
-please, add more effects that are a bit more complex.
-add a motion blur, this way you can make your videos more fluid and smooth to the eye.
(If you can’t add any of these, it’s fine! I understand.)

Bug/glitch:
One of the most annoying glitches in CapCut is when I add a video overlay, then reverse it… the overlay becomes glitched and some parts of the overlay have a black flash for a split second. I don’t know if it’s just me, but please try to fix this. Thank you.

Thank you for reading my review. I hope to hear back from CapCut soon!"
"Hi, I just want to say that Capcut is amazing. I wanted to make videos on TikTok, and since TikTok does not have a lot of editing software, I started to look around and downloaded some video editor apps that seemed pretty good, but in all of them you could barely use any of the features without a subscription. I was getting frustrated because I just couldn’t find a good editor with free features. Capcut blew my mind. It has so many features and the are all for free, and they are perfect for TikTok. I am just 15 but I love this app and would recommend to anyone."
"So I like to use this app for edits, and it’s really amazing! It has good animation, effects, audio changing. There is just one main problem for me. For some reason the style option, and I checked for photo multiple times, is not available and is instead replaced with extract audio option. Idk if this is part of a later build or if it is a glitch, but pls bring back the style option! The 3d styles are main elements for my edits and they help my edits look smoother and more cooler. So if you can, pls consider bringing back the style option.

Thx!"
"I like to edit tv shows, and CapCut is amazing for that. There are so many animation tools you can use and effects you can add--overall it's an amazing app. However, I don't like that on a video clip you can't do transitions both in and out without choosing from the combo section, but there are ways to solve that problem. And occasionally, when I want to add voice effects I can only do so by extracting a video or overlay audio, and that can sometimes get a little bit annoying. Still, the app is great for editing and I would definitely recommend!"
"I’ve used this app for a really long time and i love all of its features. it’s very intuitive and easy to use and the results are always what i picture in my head. one thing i dislike is that the style feature that allows you to do velocity automatically and cool 3D effects randomly disappeared. i used it one day and then the next the button wasn’t there anymore. i tried looking online for solutions but nothing worked. i unfortunately can’t do a lot of the edits i want to without this feature. i’m not sure why it’s not there anymore, but if it could be reimplemented that’d be great."
"This is my favorite editing app! Great and easy to understand for any new editors, but I’ve noticed one odd bug while editing. Sometimes the animation feature for stickers and text doesn’t work. I’ll have an animation selected, but it won’t actually do the animation. I have to undo and redo it a few times for it to work. Sometimes I have to restart the app or delete the sticker and retry it. It would be great if this got fixed, otherwise I absolutely love the app! Don’t worry if you’re thinking about getting it, this doesn’t take away from the experience at all."
Now I know the ones that cost money are just trying to make some money but it’s really helpful when you wanna try editing and stuff but you don’t have an editing app because they all kind of cost money most and the ones that do they have the good effects and stuff that you can’t get unless you pay CapCut has all of those for free and CapCut also is just straight up amazing I can’t even find the words to say how amazing it is I’ve had this app for months and it’s always been amazing I love it.
Capcut is a really good editing app! But I wish it could be more like video star. It’s missing graphs! If they have graphs it would make the app so much better! That’s the only thing they need to make it a good app! CapCut is super easy to use! People say “It not a good app it has pre maid transitions.” That’s not the only you can do in CapCut you can do effects and other things. People are just not using the app right. You need practice you can say it’s a bad app without practice. Like I’m getting better at Capcut everyday! It’s a really good app everyone should you use for edits! All It needs is graphs and the app with blow up!
"This app is by far the best editing app! (That I’ve used so far, I am trying some new ones though) What is really great about it is that it has no ads. Ads are very annoying especially if you use the app often like I do. If your looking for a good editing app to use, this is a good one! However, there are minor issues. There is a lot of really good beginner editing apps and this could be a good one! (I started out with KineMaster) I give this five because it has really good transitions (smooth ones) and really good effects, and more! :)"
"Cap cut is an amazing app but what annoys me sometimes is that sometimes it doesn’t let me trim how much I want to like let’s say it’s at 2.5 but it switches it self to 2.1 that’s what annoys me but other than that it’s an amazing app amazing effects transitions amazing amazing! You can also do velocity easily plus it doesn’t have a watermark like other apps for example funimate puts a watermark when you submit your video but not CapCut also is everything is free you don’t have to pay for anything yes, it also has key frames!"
"It’s a really easy editing app and they turn out really good however I do have an idea for another feature, because it takes so long to shorten a lot of pictures to the same length I think there should be a feature where you can select all the pictures you want to and shorten them to the same length at the same time ( and a select all feature if you add this) but even if the developer doesn’t see this it’s still a great editing app and I definitely recommend it! :)"
"First of all I love this app. I can edit my videos easily and quickly. Sometimes when I try to import something it says, could not import. This makes me frustrated because then I have to wait multiple hours to fix itself. And sometimes it will say insufficient storage try again later. So, I clean out all my old projects and camera roll. It still says that. I then have to wait over 24 hours for it to register. This makes me very sad because this is a great editing app but if there is anything I can do to fix or prevent this, then please let me know."
"This is by far my favourite editing app, because I do not have enough money to use other apps, and I love how there isnt a watermark, so my edits are much better. Its just, when I go to use the button called ""Animation"" it only lets me use ""In"" or ""Out"", never both. I dont know if its just the app, or if my phone isnt doing what its supposed to, but its become quite a problem because some edits require both ""In"" and ""Out"". I have Ios11 and would appreciate if you helped me, or if it actually wasnt implemented, just think about it."
"CapCut has brought me to a small roblox editing channel, of 41 subscribers. It’s a great app and it helps me with a lot of things, even happiness, believe it or not! Anyways, I do have some issues I would like to share. I only have 2 photos in my phone. Just 2. And CapCut is telling me storage is full. I do not understand why CapCut must make sure our storage is free before letting us create a video. I have deleted it and gotten in back over 15 times, and it will not stop telling me this. It’s the most annoying thing ever."
"This is a genuine app, if you are looking to see if this app is a scam/ripoff, then read this! Everything is free, and there are no ads :)

Effects:
I’ve had this app for quite a while, and it is truly amazing! You can adjust the effects however you’d like, not to mention the options are practically endless! Most apps have trashy little bursts of color and have you pay for it just to never use it and waste your money. A tip would be to download your video with your transitions, make a new project, import the video, and add in your major effects.  

Key Frames: 

You can click the “+” button to add your beginning position, and slowly move your object across the screen as you place the frames. This feature is extremely helpful, and you can adjust the speed of your object’s motion by pushing the frames closer together and moving the position farther. 

consider downloading! :)"
"You should try out this app because there are many filters you can choose from, and tons of effects and layers! On my old app, InShot, you had to buy more effects, and there weren’t as many, and also, you couldn’t get to add overlays, or called the layers! CapCut gives you an opportunity to get tons of things that most apps don’t have! And I also recommend to get the app Filto, because, they have tons of pretty filters, and more! You should try both of the apps, it’s amazing!!!"
"I LOVE THIS APP I make edits all the time and this is the go to app for me it has everything I need and I love how you can have a lot of layers but unfortunately I updated it and anything I had before I updated it I can’t open, it tells me to update it after I already did and for the past 2 days I have failed to get any of my edits finished, I wish I can say I can remake the edits but I delete photos as soon as I use them and I don’t save anything unless I want to post to the public, I hope this gets fixed cause I would love to continue my progress, have a good day everyone 😁😁😁"
"This app is amazing compared to iMovie. It has so many features and it is great. The problem I have with it is that it tend to lag. When I’m don’t exporting my finished product, it delays the volume from the video which I then have to match it perfectly so it doesn’t lag. I’m tired of doing this and I need this to be fixed so I can use this more and not look for other edit apps. I really have an issuer where if I add too much footage it goes slower and slower which is super annoying because I guess it can only withstand a video that is a couple seconds long. The people who work on this app really need to fix these issues."
"Keyframes were recently added, but there’s no way to customize the speed change/curve of the movement. Volume is hard to change, and the meter you use to change it doesn’t do much when you try to make it louder, and to make it quieter you have to almost go to ‘0’. Other than that, this app is amazing. There’s no watermark, and the transitions are pretty useful. The music they provide is copyright free, and sounds great. They’re constantly adding more and better features, and it’s very easy to use, would totally recommend"
"As transparent as I can possibly be, this app is amazing! I’ve been using it for business and personal use and it’s unlike any editing app I have! You can link TikTok sounds & you also don’t have to pay additional money for a “better package” like most other editing apps now in days. I recommend this if you wanna edit TikTok’s or Reels, videos like these will bring plenty of exposure to your business, I would recommend an app that’s easy to use for editing and this is definitely my #1 candidate right now"
This App it is a good editing app for beginners but I’m not a beginner so it’s still good it’s really good and it doesn’t have good shakes so that’s like the only thing I am really need is the shakes to be good but other than that this app is like one of the best editing apps video star you have to pay for a lot of things so this is why are use capcut other than that I love the sound it’s really good at once you like start trying to use it it becomes really easy to use and once you know after like 3 or 4 days of learning you’ll be a pro
This app is great for beginners that are trying to edit because it’s very simple and easy and it doesn’t take a long time to edit and you can upload all different stuff from this app instead of paying you don’t even have to pay completely free so I really like this app and I recommend people use this I don’t have any problems with it but sometimes while I’m making edits when I play the video it lags a  little but  once I upload it it’s fine but I struggle sometimes when I play it from there because it lags  a little overall it’s fine
"I've been using Splice for over 4 and a half years, i was introduced to you guys the other day and haven't been able to stop editing since. I've legit already spent countless hours on some of my work and i must say, this is hands down, the easiest, smoothest and, most professional editing software i've ever gotten my hands on so far. Make's me wish it wasn't free because you folks deserve some cash! Thank you for quite the experience so far, can't wait to dish out some more content."
"I love this thing. It helps me edit animations and videos and such! My problem? Wish we had more layers! It’s sometimes hard to work with the limited amount of layers we have, so maybe some more would help especially since some animators found this fun to use! Also, the movements to keyframes, sometimes I just want to tilt an image, but then I accidentally resize it and it kills me, using a phone and all. If there is an easier was to resize and tilt images it would help A LOT! Thank you."
"Hello there
This application is so satisfying as I do make videos and teach language, this app is so creative and I like to work with .
After a while working with this app it’s like it will get so many places and the history won’t clean up completely so I deleted the app and installed it again but after I did this I couldn’t use the animation feature and that’s made me sad as it was my method to teach the language and it was fun for kids to watch it, I hope you fix this problem ASAP, thanks anyway ."
I love this app it’s so easy but one day when I wanted to create something for my best friend it won’t let me! S I tried with some other photos and back it didn’t do it just because of photos! But then I tried it again with other photos and it worked. And so I tried getting the video that I want to pick and all the other photos and different things and it was done with the video but just not with the Photos. If the creator of the apps is this really try to fix this bug I want to surprise my friends for a gift! No I just went into it and it says that I have no photos on the videos!
This is an amazing app it has a lot of effects in it and has amazing quality and it dose not have ads it would be great if you had some more effects bc there already amazing just some more last night I made an edit of me and my bro and it was amazing the slow motion is amazing and I hope that you guys or you can make some more updates bc so far they are amazing I must bc really lucky that I found this app bc I use to use this over editing app and it was horrible thank you CapCut for making this amazing app👍🏽😁😆.
"So I love using CapCut to edit vids. So my first suggestion is that you make CapCut available on computers. I have a gaming computer, and there are like no good editing apps for making an intro or editing vids, and CapCut is my number one editing app and for making an intro and outro. Another suggestion is that you can add songs such as Standby, Boy in the bubble, Let me down Slowly etc. Well these are all my suggestions and I hope that they get added to this app and make it more available on all devices!"
"As an editor, I enjoy using this app and prefer it over many others. I haven’t used that many editing apps yet, but I used to only use iMovie and barely used KineMaster, CapCut was a huge upgrade from these apps! CapCut has many transitions, filters, effects, and more cool editing stuff! Oh great I’m starting to sound like an ad... From what I’ve seen so far, this app is completely free which is so great considering the multiple options you can use to make a video. I would suggest any beginner editors who want to make videos."
"Okay, so KineMaster is great and all, it’s got ads and an automatic watermark that you have to pay for to get rid of. The transitions are cool, but they don’t work on overlays. Now, CapCut is KineMaster, but better. I made a quick little test video, and it turned out wonderful. Compared to doing the same thing with KineMaster, CapCut really nailed it. Great editing tool, please don’t start making people pay for stuff like every other app did! Your app is great the way it is and I probably wouldn’t change a thing about it. Keep it up! :)"
"CapCut, why is the “styles” catalog gone? I really needed this to make my edits and post them. Now I can’t. Is this a glitch because of the new update or what? Because I’m very serious about this. I have no other app to edit with since others cost money. Others on tiktok or any other social app are wondering why y’all did this too, we all need the styles catalog. Please save this from our terror and let it back. Although cap cut is a good app so far! Thank you! ❤️ please feedback once you get this."
Ok so why the title is “Why is this happening?” it is because when I do like an effect or an animation it says I don’t have internet when I do. I am trying to do an edit I don’t know what is wrong with capcut. I tried asking my friend but she said she was fine with capcut and nothing weird happened. Can you please tell me why capcut is acting like this I mean it never happened before. I was sad I couldn’t edit and I had to use another app to edit. I LOVE capcut it’s my favorite edit app I DON’T want to not use another editing app. Please tell me what is wrong like what can I do?
"I’ve been using capcut for over 5 months and it’s a really good app considering it’s free... however there aren’t a lot of fonts and updates and bug fixes aren’t great I’ve been having a problem where when I add a transparent photo the background turns white. When I try to remove the background it says there’s no background to remove, not to mention this app takes up way too much storage and I’ve had to give up so much for this app I’m beginning to think it’s not worth it, with that said please fix this bug, thank you 🙏"
"Dear CapCut editors,
      I love this app sooo much. Honestly it’s the best photo/video editor out there. Please start adding more features and fix the gifs please. I thought that I would be able to actually put real gifs into my videos. When I did what the instructions said, it told me to do something that’s always been there. It told me how to add stickers from my photos into videos. This made me feel very disappointed about something I was looking forward to. I hope you liked this feedback."
"Hi! I love this app. It has all the things you can do to edit your videos. But I do have some suggestions!!! #1, So when you replace a video, I think there should be an option to record a new one! Especially if your using a sound, and you didn’t lip sync correctly the first time. #2. I think you guys should add more effects, like hearts above your head, and much more. (Idk if you have that effect already lol) that’s all I have to say, and I hope somebody see this! Have a great rest of your day/night."
"This app is great better than any other app that I’ve tried to use! But one problem is that on the part where you could add know text,After you add the text there’s effects, bubbles, ETC-but the problem is when I press an affect or a bubble I have to take a wild guess because it doesn’t show what the effect is and when I press it it says no Internet connection but I checked my Internet in my settings and I sure do you have Internet so if you read this or see this anyone could you please update me or tell me what’s happening?"
CapCut is a nice app but like many reviews I hate how it says out of storage I delete all my photos and videos and it’s kinda annoying and correct me if I’m wrong but when I make like a long video it loads so slow and my phone sometimes be at 5% but on the good side I love the ✨ sparkle✨ affects their so fun to use and I got some suggestions like on shortcut I don’t love the Music and when it says to go to A music app and I don’t have a Music app But the The other option is amazing thank you for your time bye 👋
"CapCut is great! It’s easy to use and the transitions are smooth and great! I always post edits on CapCut since it’s just amazing. You can change the frame rate and quality? And there’s no watermark. It’s awesome! But many people say CapCut isn’t an editing app since you choose the transitions instead of making them. So here’s some requests.
We should be able to make our own transitions and use graphs. If you did that, you’d probably get many more people to get it, and less hate. This app is amazing and if anyone is reading this, GET IT!!"
It’s really good to edit with as a bigger editor and get to use it more and stuff but a big problem I have is when it says “my storage is low and I won’t be able to edit anymore tell my storage is clear” my storage is at 3.7(something) rn I have have enough room I understand when my storage is at like 4.7 (something) but it kinda gets annoying from time to time every now and again. But besides this it’s alright to use. Why I say that is because I have no idea how to use video star or even alright motion so Capcut is my go to app for editing.
"Omg this is like my favorite app ever! I love all the new green screen features and I love the editing tools! There are so many amazing options! I also love the templates!!! They are so easy to use you just pick pictures and it does the work for you!!! I can’t express how much I love this app!💕 I would love to see the “what do you meme” filter added! That would be so cool🫶overall amazing. And for any parents wondering if this app is okay for your kids…
You can not talk to anyone nor post videos for people. So overall AMAZING app!!!!!🔥"
"I love capcut so much but it’s just so annoying at some times. For example, texts are getting deleted without me deleting them, storage always full when it isn’t even close to being full, it doesn’t delete the text or overlay, or whatever when you want it too, it isn’t even an editing app like sure it added graphs but their pre-transitions and the only transitions that aren’t premade are the basic ones: rotate, position and scale. Nothing else. and people call it an editing app. Fandom? Through the roof, but in a bad way. Attacking others for having an opinion. I can’t even with them."
"So, this is an amazing app, I love all the filters and effects and the fact you can extract things, but there is this one glitch where I tap on photos and there is no photos. When this happens I close thy app and go back in, sometimes it works, sometimes not. Also it would be cool if you could like edit an audio a little more? I know you can change the volume and speed, but I feel like I need something else. But otherwise thank you for this beautiful app!"
"Hello CapCut, your app is very good. I love using it to make edits. It’s really simple and fun to use. It’s better than most. Expect somethings I think you guys should add are like more effects like: motion blur. I would really like if you guys can make changes to the speed so when I put the speed at 0.9x or slower it’s not as choppy and looks more smooth. And I would also want more creative fonts. A bigger storage for editing. Add more things to help the quality like “adjust”.
Thanks for listening,
Zamentic"
CapCut  can you please  fix the thing we’re it say like to much storage Bc I’m losing apps and it’s making it hard Bc I ned those apps and if that keeps happening I’m going to have to delete the apps I do homework with and that’s not good for me so please I’m beginning you to fix this also if I try to go back to a. Project it’s gonna say like you have no more storage clean up some phone space and I just got that and that project took me a long time to make and I had a green screen so I had to keep changing the background for all the pictures and I had 28 or 20 something and I’m pretty frustrated with it 😅so please fix this CapCut
"1st of all I really love the app, it helps me a lot, but could u guys just add these 2 things I'm asking for? 1st thing: when we want to add an audio, can you please add a search button to look for the music we want please. 2nd: this is the last thing I'm asking but could u please add a thing where we can color on the pictures we want, bcs there is this 1 picture I need to color on so could u please please please please!!!! Add these 2 things? That's all I'm asking for!!!! Please and Thank u!!!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸"
"I love capcut and have used it for a year now. It is so easy to use and quick to learn; however, I lost part of the update from 3 days ago.
  I’m not sure if anyone else is having this issue, but I can no longer access the glowing boarder added in the what I believe was the latest update. If you removed this feature then that makes more sense. But I would still like to understand what happened, and why I am not able to use it like I could just yesterday."
"CapCut is amazing I love it it has everything you would want in a editing app but after 2 or 3 edits it stopped letting me add photos it would only let me add photos in the preview I tried hitting the plus replacing it nothing worked so I stopped using it ,if they fixed this glitch I would use it so much more but until they fix it I will only use it like once a week or so and not even finish the edit their is also a recommendation I would have you should add more filters and animations I can’t really think of any examples but it would really help in variety"
"I love this app, the watermark at the end instead of in the clips is great, I love the filter as well, but maybe the transitions could be better? Or more maybe. Perhaps add more options to add more than 1 movement at a time. I would like to better more if there are new or better transitions, like smooth or options with the key frames making them a bit more smoother to use for smooth transitions to different clips? Overall it’s a great app, thank you for reading, I appreciate it."
"This app is freaking perfect for any person trying to start making edits, yet the app has so much to offer that you can use this as your main app and need nothing else. The animations make it look as if it is from Adobe after effects and with no watermark either. You can use keyframes too, although I would like to request for CapCut to have the option add different easing to the keyframes, although not necessary. But again, love it, really easy, and I would recommend it."
"This app is so great! You can edit your videos fairly easily with no adds or watermark which is kind of a big deal considering I’ve seen editing apps full of ads and that have watermarks that are much worse quality. Obviously nothing is perfect but the only thing I have a suggestion about is just maybe labeling or giving some directions because even I have found it is kinda hard to tell what does what. Otherwise, I really love this app and you should 100% download it for editing!"
"Please make more transitions! I would love to have more As I am An instagram editor But other than some lagging I absolutely love this app! It does lag time to time when adding too much effects but I love the animations,the transitions and the effects! Wish you could add more camera transitions and animations too! Like more 3D animations and there is no watermark. I was very shock that this app is completely free I love that it provides a lot of aesthetic things too! I would rant more But all I got to say is this is one of the best apps!"
"Great app, best transition effects and UI on the market. But unlike VN, where you can control image duration for 1/100th of a second and time up your shots perfectly, here you can only control image duration to tenth of a second. This just isn’t enough for what people want to do with your app, like produce photo/video content that syncs with a user’s audio. Please guys, I can’t use this app for my content because of it. All I ask is that you expand this functionality so that your app can be used to the best of its ability. Thank you very much"
"One thing tho if u have this app then yk that u can do “shortcuts” and I like using those they r very helpful but some of the music On them is kinda weird. ikkk u can change the music but I think it ppl would like and use the shortcuts more if they they were kinda like those tiktoks that ppl make and mayb u could use some of those is u got permission IDK or just make yr own CapCut😂😂

Btw my favvvv shortcuts is the song where it says “ you know that I won’t stop until I make you mine, until I make you mine” then after that part in the song it gets slow like THATS WHAT IM TALKING ABT MAKE MORE SHORTCUTS LIKE THAT PLZZZZZ"
"I haven’t seen a video editing app with as much features as this one on a mobile market. Not to mention everything is free. You literally are given tools that are able to create beautiful videos. This app is as good as you are, because the sky is the limit. There’s only one feature I wish this app had was a more in depth audio editor like an equalizer. That’s the only weak part of this app. There’s features on this app you won’t see anywhere else."
"I have fixed the issue (using a bunch of storage for this app) but i think you guys can fix jt for others. This app is wonderful and even without paying its amazing, an app like no other. But unfortunately when i first had the app it had 7 gigs taken just for fonts, effects, filters, and then the basic things which I think is unbelievable. It is mostly my fault but if developers can help or fix this please do. Besides that, this app is amazing and I wont be changing editing apps for a while."
"It’s a amazing, but I give it four stars because, I am not fully sure it’s a bug or just me. but when I was gonna make a new video. It said I had no storage, so I deleted some videos. Then it STILL said I had some bad storage then I ended up deleting all my work in Capcut. And guess what? It still said the storage wasent enough. I also tried to fix it by doing the settings things, and I had to restart it over and over again. I really want fixed. If it’s fixed I would be really happy and can work on my videos again. thank you so much <3"
"Hi, cap cut needs some work. I mean it’s a amazing great app and I use it to practice editing but, I had to delete a bit of files to get cap cut back for me to edit which to me is SUPER annoying. And every time I make a kinda long video/edit it says “To much storage, try again later.” And I try again later and it says the same thing I mean, I delete some of the apps on my phone but after that still needs me to continue deleting everything. If anyone wants this review to go up to a 5 star I really need this fixed because I am almost out of games to play on my phone. Thank you for reading ✌🏽😄"
I’m a love editing so I got this app cause my friends recommended to me and so I’m like it can’t be that bad so I go in and I make like 2 or 3 edits and what I go and get the film I will use for the edit and then I go back in and I press news edit and it’s like you need to delete photos so I did I deleted 267 photos and it still said it so I did it again and it still said it and I was like ok well I will deleted the app and get it again so I try clicking on it and it say you can’t edit till you delete photos so I’m so mad because I take hours on my edits but it’s just gone and I will try again but it won’t work I know it
CapCut is an amazing editing app and I have been using it the past year for lots of things. Something I loved to use was the fun sound effects that added comedy to my videos! Over the past couple weeks I have noticed I’m not able to do it anymore because the app says “No internet. Connect to the internet to try again” even when I am connected to the internet it will not go away so I have been unable to use CapCut to its full capabilities. Please let me know if there is anyway to fix this but besides that it is truly an amazing app!
"I really enjoy this app it helps a lot for my vids and edits but there is a few things that should be added but since I don’t want to overwhelm you or anything lm just going to name one… so lm starting a new video idea and it involves that voice sound thing.. l hope you know what l mean but l was thinking could you add more voices? It gets kinda boring and annoying with three voices… so you should add more especially the male, and you don’t have to add a whole bunch of voices maybe just one or two.. thank you!"
"CapCut is so amazing! It has every advanced feature I would expect from an app I would have to pay for! I still cant believe this is free because its just so good!! It has no ads either by the way. i love capcut because it has all the basics and more, u can remove the background and put in whatever you want and its soooo good for making superhero movies with alll the effects and the stickers. thankyou so much to the people who made capcut, your amazing thank you. would 10/10 DEFINITELY recommend. 👌😊🙂 love your app!"
"I started using this in 2020 in June and it was going really great. That is until a tiny problem happened in 2021 April 23. I was working on a edit when, I was trying to put an audio in. The problem was when it loaded it freezed and no audio came on the edit. Mind you it was a really special edit for someone and I really wanted to get it done that day. So I tried it again and it still wouldn’t work I reset it and everything. I’m gonna try to delete it and install it back. Hopefully it works! Other then that the app is really good."
"I really like to use CapCut to make gacha videos alongside Kinemaster! And it’s really helpful when it has something Kinemaster doesn’t. But, today I was making a gacha video and I added in the audio right after I added the photos. Once I adjusted the photos to my liking I was gonna ad an overlay, but when I clicked the overlay button the only thing I could add were videos and stock videos. When I tried to add more photos it wouldn’t let me. This has happened multiple times and it’s really annoying to deal with."
"This is the first time I have ever written a review for an app but this deserves 5 stars because of how fantastic this app is! There is no watermark and it has all the features you are looking for in one app. This app is so easy to edit and create videos it's astonishing. There are many effects and wonderful transitions. Lastly, one feature I love is the auto caption feature, it writes the text of the audio and you are able to customize it any way you want! Once again get this app it's the best video editing app ever 👍"
"One thing that I would suggest for the developers is to allow more “freedom” within the app (in my case I just want to be able to rotate the “split” mask diagonally). I feel like letting users modify the masks and effects to fit their needs would greatly increase your number of consumers because unlike other video editing apps, I like that you have great effects and editing tools all laid out for free. (Edit I just found out how to do that. I am very pleased with this app 10/10 will always recommend)"
"I’ve been using capcut since 2020 in every new device that I get capcut is very good it helps a lot since I’m learning how to edit more and more everyday. But can we get Velocity please  I would really appreciate that. Also,Sometimes when I’m editing And I press to see another edit The edit that I was editing before goes to the bottom so can you pleaseeeeee Put a thing that reminds us the edit we where working on.I think Everyone Should Honestly Get this app it’s free and No ads❤️."
So basically I am a ROBLOX story time maker and I was making a story and I was adding my I think six characters and just immediately I just said that my overlays are done I can’t use them anymore and I’m gonna need the overlay so I can finish it and I just have to keep going to a separate project so I can finish it and I do not like agree that I should do this Cuz it’s kind of annoying and what’s the point of like having to use CapCut for the overlays like I might as well use it for the text instead of the overlays if it’s gonna have a limit because I can’t deal with making a new project so I can just add the overlays
"I have never really tried to edit stuff, and when I found Cap Cut, that changed. It’s pretty easy to use, and  even if you don’t have tiktok, you get lots a songs to choose from.  Have been using it for about a year now, so I have gotten the hang of it. There is only one thing I don’t like about it, I wish you could also just put the fun fonts of photos, not just videos, but there are so many other apps for that, so I don’t mind. Thank you soo much for creating Cap Cut, it’s amazing!"
"I was trying to edit a video for a project but these other editing platforms would glitch out or make me pay for almost all the features. CapCut, on the other hand, let me edit the video easily on my phone, and I had zero, I repeat, zero problems with it. It didn’t even take me long! You don’t have to pay for anything, you can easily use the features, it’s easy to navigate, and you can remove the watermark, too. I’m very satisfied and love this app already! :)"
"I love this app because of three main reasons:

1. It’s completely free! There’s no hidden or revealed in-app purchases! All the other apps I found in the App Store either cost money to download or something in the app cost money, like the soundtracks, effects, filters, animations, etc. This app has a lot to offer, and all for free!

2. The fact that you can extract sound from videos! I like to make songs on GarageBand and screen-record them, then extract the audio so I can put it to my pictures or other edits in CapCut. Other apps either make you pay to unlock the extract feature, or just don’t have it all together! Plus, CapCut makes the process easy to add my favorite audio!

3. The effects, filters, and animation! There could be a little bit more body effects, but other than that, the animations as a whole are stunning!"
"Hey so i hope your reading this message well I wanted to say that CapCut is a great app it’s amazing! No water mark and everything is free but… I would love for you to add more transitions like a hand transitions where a hand slides over it and it changes to the next picture? I would love for you to add that also I wanted to ask is there any premium (why am I asking this it’s all free lol) also I love chroma key! It doesn’t show the green screen/ pink screen well that’s all from me!
Edit: also please ADD GRAPHS"
So I make content using CapCut to edit. I was trying to put a photo like normal (I couldn’t remove it and put it back or it would ruin the video) and it would do it BUT SO SLOWLY! And the sensitivity just seemingly went up a lot. I tried closing the app and restarting my phone but nothing happened. I spent 30 minutes trying to do something that would normally take less then 1. There is also times where if there is a lot of photos it won’t pick up all of them unless you save the video.
"I’ve been an editor for a year now, wondering how in the world everyone had been improving on their anime edits and fan edits yet I was stuck in the mud with barely any good apps AT ALL! Capcut is completely free and basically water mark free too. It’s crazy how amazing and wide spread this app is, you can NEVER get bored!! Every edit I make on this app makes me so happy because I am finally improving as an editor after months of trying with the same bad apps! Thank you for the developers who made this app!! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!! 🤧❤️"
"Don’t get me wrong, this app is AMAZING. But a lot of the time it says I need to free up storage, I literally delete 100 photos just for it to work and it doesn’t even let me use it! I love it but I really want it fixing right now. 
Next thing is that maybe add more transitions because I want to look for the one I want since I can’t use videostar or other apps I don’t know how to edit with.
The next thing is that PLEASE add more songs because some are really bad and if I want to make my own song I have to screen record and do it but over all this app is alright but it just needs a lot more work done to it."
"I honestly want to start off by saying capcut is a really good app for editors, or anyone who is looking to go into the editing stage I do have minor problems with capcut the glitches,lagging,storage of your reading this capcut please please PLEASE make us have a log in account so whenever the app is deleted we can have an account to log back into to see our old things we done on the app that’s the only thing I want I don’t like how when we reinstall the app there’s no log in which means everything is loss please take this idea into consideration 🙏"
"I’m an editor and I love this app sm!! Not very good for transitions but it’s still amazing for any other type of edit. The only thing I would suggest is adding in folders so that you can categorize your edits. I have a lot of edits I think like over 150 and it’s rlly hard to find the one I’m trying to find. Also I edit all different sorts of things and it would be great to have like one folder of unfinished stuff one folder of finished stuff, stuff like that would make it a lot easier to use. 👍👍"
"Capcut is, out of all the editing apps I have used, simply the best. Capcut is 100% free plus there are no ads to stop you while using it. It offers more features than any editing app I have used, plus new ones being added often. It is also extremely user friendly and only takes minutes to learn. Overall I HIGHLY recommend this app if you are an inspiring video creator or just someone who needs to put video clips together."
I think that this app is very amazing for beginners such as myself! The controls are very easy and understanding and there is no confusion whatsoever. This was my first editing app and I got so excited for the shakes and the shakes are very easy to understand. Capcut also has audios and sounds. Sound effects and also music! The sound effects are very realistic and I love them a lot. The overlays are absolutely stunning and the green screens work very well I definitely recommend using this app for a green screens!!
"After all the videos I used to make compared to this apps videos. What a big difference, there’s amazing effects, frames, you can remove background add stickers and overlay. You can transition and add speed, volume, contrast. Create amazing videos! My go-to! I love it so much! Don’t chance a thing, it’s PERFECT. When you save, everything is clear, this app is very user friendly! It  doesn't have a watermark except at the end, which is totally fine! Amazing app! Get it now :)"
"I have an idea. Well we should have an option for different levels of editing, you could have modes like “self crop” and i thought of an “effect” called scribble! It lets you take a clip that has some time of animation in it (affect animation or intro) it lets you take the animation or shake from the video and put it in to yours. Say if i wanted my clip to slide up and down but I couldn’t because there was no animation for it, i could add the clip of the animation and it would put it on. Tell me what you think <3"
"I don’t normally write reviews,  but I just had to say how much I adore this app that gives us quality editing tools and it’s all FREE. I’ve already made a few edits with it and my favorite part is definitely the ready-to-go transitions and effects that make it fun and easy for beginners (like myself). The only thing I wish for is more transitions for the In and Out options, and I want to be able to use them both on a single clip. Other than that, great app! Keep up the work!"
"This app is amazing! Other than the fact of me adding an effect to my gacha video and everything messing up this is by far the best editing app I’ve used for anything! I would 100% recommend downloading! Now, it may take a while to master it and understand how it works but once you get the hang of it it’s easy as a piece of cake! Y’all better not be using it for mean edits! Show some support to this amazing app and enjoy your creations!"
Listen the app is really good and great for editing but every time I have to restart my phone like8 times for it to work it would say full storage then I deleted all my photos and it still says it I delete my recent projects and it still says it thanks a lot now I have no photos and no recent projects I’m deleting it now! Update: yes I’m back editing my review… this is a problem I have plenty of storage and I keep deleting and downloading again guess what? Didn’t work. And I have to keep restarting my phone which you guessed it.. it still doesn’t work even tho I have to pay I’m switching to video star I’m deleting this app for good.
"Hi Capcut! I have a few suggestions for this app how it can upgrade on everybody's editing more -

1. Motion Blur

Motion blur is very much of good way of having a smooth transitions and shakes, so it won’t have to be so sloppy

2. More shakes

I like the shakes that we have now, but I think it’s that time of day that I ask for QR CODES, so instead of having to do different things for shakes, we can have QR codes.

3. Graphs

Graphs are the most important thing I suggest, so other editors can actually do more time on their editing, and make their own shakes, think of it as Videostar! 

Last thing, 4. Smooth slow-mo, more leveling effects, and upgrading editing

All of these is something that would be really amazing to have, so it will be very good if we can have these last 4 things.

But that’s all! overall, I really enjoy this app!"
"I love using CapCut. As a TikTok content creator; this app has allowed me to edit videos at a professional level without having to worry about paying for a monthly subscription. I fell in love with the app as soon as I saw we are able to remove the watermarks. I plan to use CapCut a lot in the future. My only complaint is sometimes when I insert a-lot of pictures, the app removes some from the frames, leaving me with blank spaces or frozen screens. Other than that, this app is perfect, simple to use, and professionally set up and designed. Thank you CapCut!"
"Honestly. The apple itself is pretty good upgrade if your going from for example kinemaster / imovie to CapCut. It has no watermarks and gives you more transitions and effects / animations. Definitely hope that they could make it so that you could stack up animations instead of doing them and then export, edit again in CapCut. Export. Do it again. However honestly the app itself is amazing. No doubts about that and definitely hope that they won’t make a paywall for a removal of watermark or something."
"I don’t like it kinda because it don’t have a lot of edits. Also, why can’t y’all put a search for the music and, not from the gallery because, we might not have the song and have to go get the song. Also, I feel like y’all should have a lot more stuff. A lot of the editing stuff I have on my phone has a lot of stuff to do. I tried to do a edit but, there was not a lot of stuff as I imagined there was going to be. It was hard for me to find out where stuff was. I am new to this I haven’t explored all of it yet. But, that is all I needed to tell for y’all to fix and get more stuff."
"I LOVE CAPCUT. But even though I love it I think there could be some changes to it. First I think loops would be really good for animations and help out a lot of people. I also think that editors should get more options in animation “in” and “out” because there is not many choices and they kinda limit editors on their options. Final addition capcut should add is more stock videos, more stock videos can probably help beginners add more to their videos and make them better."
"First off, I can’t even find the sounds I want to use. There’s not even a search option to even look for certain songs you want to use. It only shows original sounds that people made on TikTok! 
Secondly, the option to make the lyrics appear on-screen while the audio plays is not present, so how do other people have this feature?! And if it even gets added, it won’t even work! 
I would give this app 5 stars if it actually works the way other users get it to work, but I’m sorry. I had to give it 1 star because it is so difficult to use.
I recommend a more easier to use app like iMovie or FilmoraGo. Those apps actually work as advertised, this doesn’t…."
"(Yes this is a real review I’m not a bot :3) This app is AMAZING once you learn how to use it well, they add updates frequently and they have multiple options. They also have a chroma key which allows you to have whatever background you want (if you have a green screen, pink screen, blue screen etc.) Awesome. It’s also completely free! No annoying ads will interrupt you while editing, and you can remove the watermark for free! It’s amazing ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ five stars. Definitely recommend this to new editors!"
"I’ve been using CapCut for years, it’s a great app and it’s so easy to use!! It’s the easiest editing app I’ve ever used but there’s one problem that I’m just starting to notice.. Whenever I make videos and add a lot of cuts and clips it starts glitching and won’t play some clips, it’ll just skip them or be stuck on one clip. It’s been doing this for 2 months or so, I’ve swiped the tab and exited the video then re entering it and it still does this. I’m not sure why, the app doesn’t need to update. Please fix this as soon as possible!!!!"
"So, I've been making videos on this app for about 4 months now. An excellent app, that I really like using and is very easy to understand. But I do have problems with exporting and some glitches, for example when exporting a 20 minute video, I had little clips with text. After exporting and checking the video the clips had scatter into different parts of the video. If they could change this glitch it would be very appreciated, thank you for reading!"
I love this app and I use it for all my edits but I hate that everything has to face forward. I don’t really know how to explain but for exmple everyone knows about the Nagito edit that blew up and the Miu Iruma big juicy edit. Thoes edits were fantastic but they used apps like ae and alightmotion because in capcut u Canot put things to an angle which is very annoying. For example if I was making an edit and I needed a Circle to turn for the bg but it was supposed to be facing upwards I would have to use a different app because even with the key frames I can only turn it certain ways.
The reason i gave this app 4 stars is because why cant u add two pics and make it look like its MOVINGGGGGG AGH but although i love this app it might need more effects like “fade“ so u make it look like it dissapeared. And also custom music so u can choose music from ur library and why does it say the copyright thing and its protected IDKKKKKKK WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY but this app so far is GREAT i got this app from my friend? Idk if she my friend still but i got this app from my friend and so far im using to edit my gacha club vids and like videos! Thank u for reading my review bye! Stay safe and were ur mask!
So I like to edit stuff and this app is great it has everything! Text to cool stickers also you can remove the watermark and the app isn’t constantly asking you to pay for something! Also if you want to make a quick edit you can just insert photos/videos and boom a edit! Also if you don’t have tik tok (like me) then all the cool filters are in there!!! Including time warp (my fav) and a bunch more!! Download the app sooo many pros and not very many cons!!! Tysm for reading hope it helps bye!
Hi CapCut makers and creators I love your app so much it was the best decision I have ever made for an app it is completely free love the editing and so much more I love that you can create audio from one of your videos this app got me so inspired if you are a person looking at the reviews before getting an app I WOULD RECOMMEND so much thank u for reading this if you get a chance !😄 (update) : still love the app thanks soooo much for the more advanced transitions can you PLEASE make more I’d love that so much for my edits
"so when i got capcut i was generally new at editing and it was surprisingly easy to make good looking edits so quickly. i still use capcut BUT as a growing editor i think that there should be smoother slo-mos, velocity, and graphs should definitely be added. more effects and overlays would be amazing as well. other than that i really don’t have a problem with the app. it’s a good beginner and more advanced editing app. it’s free and no watermark. i definitely recommend :))"
"i use capcut and you know! There might be bad storage problems, but i really still like the app! I make amazing edits on there and its just so helpful for me because all i used to have was clips and I didnt make things to call an edit, but because of capcut and can make an edit that’s actually decent, now if you want a app with kinda easy controls then download capcut, but if you want a little bit on confusion then download video star and video star +. + costs money and the regular one is free. Goodbye!!"
"This app is so good but i wish they had like better translitions or you could make your own translitins.. like you can make ur own custom translition and add like motion blur too it or you could add more than 1 translition at a time. another problem i have is storage. i have a lot of free storage and even on other apps it says i have enough storage to edit but all the time on here it says i have low storage.. Please figure that glitch out! and i wish you could add more overlays too or even add more voices for the text speech

thanks for listening"
"This app is amazing! <3 it’s good for beginners! :D and perfect for making Gacha memes and movies! I never knew about this app until my very old friend in tiktok told me about this. She would make edits of Addison Rae. I asked her what app she uses, she told me it’s capcut! I’ve tried many editing apps since I make gacha mini movies, music videos, memes etc! For myself and this is the best one I found! It’s effects are really good! :D it also has no watermark imao. I will definitely use this app to make more gacha memes/movies in the future for myself! :D"
So capcut is awesome I've been using this app for a while but I don't know why they removed velocity because once they added that feature it was really good and made my edits perfect but once they removed it every thing kept saying I have bad wifi although I have full bars also that now when you want a specific effect won't let you put it on there nothing cost money which is very good it's just it needs a whole bunch of wifi and just asking why they had to remove velocity if the creator can respond back and tell me why that would be good.
"I love this app, but i've been getting so much bugs and glitches in this app because It wouldn't load for me and wouldn't play the video at all. this app is also super slow for me too. I was using this app for editing and this app is extremely slow. when I add cuts into my video i'm editing it really chugs and stops the video sometimes and would crash the app. I really wish you guys could fix your app and patch most of the things I mentioned."
Okay so I love how this doesn’t have premium and no watermark and you can delete the end but please add more effects like ghost effects! and some more effects! I really loved the old CapCut too bc it had effects I like so I’d bring it back but If no please add more effects if you know roblox edits they are amazing so could you add some more effects so if you don’t know roblox edits watch them! And I want you to add some of the effects you see in roblox edits! Really great app!
So some apps like Zoomerang and this (capcut) won’t let me access camera or photos cuz it says that I need to allow it then I press confirm or whatever it says and it brings me to settings where I can allow it but there is no choice for photos or camera so I don’t know if it has to do with my phone or the apps but I’m really sad cuz I spend a lot of time making edits and this is the best app for that so I just want to know if anyone else has had this problem
"FIRST of all- this is one of the best apps ever, I use it a lot to edit my vids for yt! :) you can pretty much do everything for FREE, Not even any ADDS. I am not kidding you can get so much for free and no adds, COUNT me in. Now this editing app is mostly a beginner app but if ur not good at editing you won’t see a notice. This has so many nice animation, transitions, effects, and if u just search up CapCut edits you will so many amazing edits people made from this app. Get it, it’s worth ur time and very easy to follow :) -Sah"
"It says I don’t have enough storage. I asked my friend and she doesn’t know. I haven’t even made a video yet. I don’t know what’s going on. I have enough storage though so I don’t know why it’s telling to get rid of some photos or stuff. I don’t have max photos, I can still take photos, I tried resetting my iPad nothing happens. So now I can’t make videos until I “clear out my photo album”. I’m new here or to this app so I don’t know most of the features. I’m really disappointed and would like a response with help."
I’m trying to make an edit as one does with this app but it’s really glitchy. At one point I couldn’t see the photos in the bar things at the bottom they were just black and also it’s lag is awful for me. I was trying to add a transition to part of it and it was super laggy and was taking about 10 seconds to even add the transition. the same thing happens when I try to adjust the length of a photo or video. Aside from that I really love this app. If these glitches were fixed i’d be very happy.
"I love this app and all, but there is a bug that is very crucial. I was creating a project (under a minute) and I put a lot of pictures in it. When I left the app and reopened it, I couldn't open my project at all. I tried everything. Offloading the app, creating duplicates, restarting my device, nothing works. I could even open all the other projects, but just not that one. I'm really frustrated and I can't restart the whole project because it's too long. Please fix this problem."
"So I've been paying $5 a month for the past 3 years for a Video Editing App that has it all!!! Recently I spent 9+ hours on my largest video with the most editing, only to have the App crash EVERYTIME I tried to transfer it to my Photo/Video storage...🙄😡 So I came across this new App & noticed it contains the same editing features as the $5 deal... & this one is FREE..... So Far So Good... I keep waiting for it to let me down- but SO FAR SO GOOD... 
Let's Hope I can say bye bye to that old App & HELLO to the $60 a yr this app will save me...
☯️ZenModeling☯️"
"Phenomenal app. It does lag but it’s reasonable, the best parts are they way it’s free and how easy it literally is to use, and your edits can be amazingly good if you’re even creative enough and getting used to it enough. Only problem are updates, you guys could make a lot more better stuff editors could use like smoother animations instead of random stuff, one of my suggestion is that you guys work on adding more font styles for text just like kind-master."
"This review will be short but i’d just like to say this app is awesome, it has great edit options it seem like over 1000 and it gives you recommendations and gives you copyright free music from all genres  it is great whether your making an edit for social media or just making a personal video for fun. I greatly recommend it! And with all the options it may seem confusing but just watch some tutorials and it will be easier then it looks! Great app!"
"So I downloaded CapCut to edit pictures and videos and when I try to cut a scene short but end up not liking it, it’s to short to change because of the transition lines, and I have to start all my hard work over again. So I really think what you guys should do is make transition like animation, so when you press the edit it has transition and animation and ect, but overall this app is great! Just that the white transition lines can be in the way when your trying to delete a short mistake."
"capcut is literally the best editing app ever for beginner editors! i’ve used this app for about 4 months now and it’s brought my channel to 20k subs 💗 but from the pass couple months capcut STOPPED working. i didn’t do anything, but one day i join capcut to make an edit and everything i press says “no internet connection” i’ve watched many videos to fix this problem and they all involve VPNS which i don’t think i should have to install to get back to capcut. i just really hope capcut can fix this problem soon.."
So I started using the app and everything worked fine for about a week and the I tried to make and edit and every time I add a new picture after the first image a screen shows up that says and text and I can’t get rid of it. So now every time you watch the edit to see what it looks like on the second screen it just says “Add text here” right in the middle of the screen and I never even put a text bubble there and it will not go away. Please fix this.
"Hello to whoever is reading this or the creators who might be reading this but probably aren’t- You guys did an amazing job at creating this free-in-all video editing app! It surely is amazing and probably the best one out there, I love the stickers, how you can use green screen with it, the overlays, and all the affects! This app.. Its a masterpiece!!!! The features, it’s free, the affects are awesome, the stickers are too and you can do practically anything with this app! I really recommend downloading it 🥰😋😊😌"
"This app is great because ⟟ make videos for fun but ⟟ would like to be able to see it on other devices like my iPad. I think you could make accounts and we’d all have the same things but so ⟟ can watch it on other devices. I’m not saying i don’t know about the sharing feature, it’s just that ⟟ would like to be able to have a way to have one project on one device and be able to edit it and still have the ability to edit on another device"
"this app is so great, it’s easy to use and understand and most importantly NO WATERMARK 😳 all i have to say is you’re very limited with the animations you can use for text when it comes to the text moving. the text is always in the same spot. what i’m trying to say is add some text animations that..move around? kind of like regular animations, like swing, zoom, rotate, stuff like that but with text? hope this reaches you, if you see this it would be great if you could add some more, thank you"
"When I got this, I was very impressed with how professional it looked. It’s really good because of the variety of transitions and filters, plus they are all free. It’s really easy to use if you are a beginner and if you like to make fancam, amvs, etc. Also, the ability to extract the audio and the ability to overlay is some thing you wouldn’t normally see for free. My only complaint is how underrated this app is, it needs at least 4.8 stars. I will definitely suggest this app to other people😊"
"I have been using this app for a few months now and I still am in love with it. I have been using it to edit all my videos and it even my photos as well. There r sooooo many awesome features u can use such a text, filters, stickers, overlays, and so much more!!! I don’t see any problems with this app and if you r having troubles it is problems just your devise. This app is super easy 2 use and really can make your videos/photos magical."
"So I’ve been editing videos on this app for about a year now and it’s a great editing app. I absolutely love it but, I’ve seen a new update where there is smooth slowmo and its only for version 5.5.0 . I cant update my capcut to get it I think it’s because I’m on iPad but I was wondering when version 5.5.0 is going to release on iPad gen 7 because that’s what I use to edit but other than that it’s a amazing editing app and I really recommend it!"
One thing I do not like about CapCut is when it tells me I have no storage when I cleaned half of my iPad out with my apps and photos I literally only have 4 apps that are really important to that I can’t delete I can delete my photos but not apps which I literally have only 4 important apps. So now I have No photos and it’s still saying I don’t have any storage and to go make storage. So could you please fix that because every time I edit some videos then save them at least when I make another video it’s saying I have no storage. Will you please Fix that.
"First off, I’d like to thank the creators of this app for making it free to use for everybody. Most apps as good as this do not allow it and make u pay crazy amount of money or buy a subscription for something not even as close to good as this. Second of all, id like to acknowledge how good the effects are. These are some crazy good effects. And lastly, how easy it is to use!! This app is probably the easiest editing app I have ever seen/used and will definitely remain that way. Great job!!!"
"I have been using capcut for 2 years now and I can say from experience that this is way better than kinemaster forcing you to buy a subscription to remove the water mark but with capcut there is no water mark on the videos I edit plus it’s totally free!!!! So if you are looking for a video editor that is free simple easy to use than capcut is the option for you pal! 

Thank you for making my 2 years wonderful capcut :D"
"I love this app 100% it’s 100% free and a removable watermark! And really good transitions, animations, and really good stickers, and they have pip (picture in picture)! But there always some cons though I really think they should add green screens, more free to use music, more filters like from Colourtone, the ability to import text, more font options, and fix the text box bug, and lastly more sound effects thank you if you are reading this have a good day!"
"CapCut isn’t actually that bad. It’s a reliable app I use for my gacha TikTok’s, but the only problem is that I have to crop my photos. I’m not quite sure if there is a “fill in, or fit in” option in the app. If not, I recommend these options since I’m having a really difficult time, I own an apple x. (I’m sorry, I can’t explain things lol) These phones have black those black borders where you can see the time, and battery. But like I said, it’s an amazing app and this is the only problem I’m really having difficulties with, thank U:)❤️"
"So when I downloaded this app, I was having fun. I was enjoying the transition effects and other stuff. I was riding high until today. 

I have a big school project with a friend due tomorrow, and I'm afraid I might fail BECAUSE OF THIS APP. This morning, I spent some time in CapCut working in the project. This evening, I opened it. All the progress I made in the morning was GONE. But I thought, no big deal, probably a one time glitch. 45 minutes later, it deleted my progress again! 45 precious minutes TO COMPLETE WASTE!

So yeah. Fix your app please. Before I stop using it."
"This app is great and all but some of the effects (specifically the ones in the party section) don’t work the unreal effect, the shake effect etc. and i find it very annoying bc i need the unreal effect for a certain edit but it just won’t work i’ve tried it on both videos and photos i’ve tried it with different effects on top of it i’ve tried it with basically everything even deleting and reinstalling the app didn’t work please fix this it’s really annoying"
"It would just be amazing of you could add a feature where I could save my own text styles, this would include animations key frames, anything I add to that text would be saved. 

The second thing you should add is a feature where if I drag the text for the whole video and add the animation, make it so that when I split the text in half both texts get the animation 

Right now when I split the text, the animation has to be reapplied to the second half of the split, and it’s tedious to add every time."
"This truly is an amazing app, especially for beginners. I’ve tried so many apps and programs because I’ve wanted to learn how to edit since I saw it existed, but CapCut has really introduced me to key aspects of the art form better than anything else. I get so excited to create using this app. As I’ve learned more about editing though I really think the app could benefit from a tiles function outside of the preset animations (maybe in the effects section of the app?)"
"Overall its great and easy to use and beginner friendly. And the fact that its free surprises me. But anyways here are some suggestions:
1. Graphs!! I feel like if you add graphs it will be more confusing, but If you make it just a simple graph mechanic it will be simple and easy, although you should make it an options in settings to do advanced and what advanced will mean like to be able to do graphs or not. Graphs will just make edits a lot smoother. 

2. Being able to import text fonts! There is a pretty wide variety of fonts, but it would be even better if we could import our own.

3. More transitions! 

Anyways thats all. But 5/5 i do recommend this app. Very user friendly. EVERYTHING Free and I hope it stays like that. The fact that it makes editing 100x easier and FREE simply amazes me."
"CapCut is awesome. But what I mean from the title is that:

In the CapCut studio, sometimes the preview seems low-quality, laggy, and unmoveing. 
   Well, if you export it then in your photos it’s wayyy better! It’s much more high quality and clear then in the studio. It’s 100% free to use and has no watermark- (only at the end but you can crop it.)

it has dozens of filters, effects, and transitions to use, which is SUPER helpful! Also in the home screen there’s a feature called ‘feature overview’ which is like a tutorial but much more short and easy to understand, which helped me a lot.

In conclusion, (I’m sorry if this is like a essay 😂) CapCut is easy to use, high quality, and will definitely not meet your expectations but go above them. (They’re WAY beyond your expectations, they go higher then that.)"
"I tried the app out because my brother recommended it and boyyyy was I impressed. The effects, animation, sounds, etc were exactly what I wanted and I’m obsessed! The problem is, when I started creating videos that were about 15 minutes long, it started getting really glitchy. I lost lots of my work that I worked really hard on. I spend HOURS on end editing and if it keeps glitching on my work, I’m going to have to stop using the app. So please, PLEASE fix this, because I love this app and I don’t want to stop. 
Ty!"
I really like cap cut and I do lots of edits there but I tried to do a velocity edit and how I do it is that I g to style and put auto velocity I tried doing that right now but I can find style anymore maybe one way to do a velocity edit is maybe by adding a velocity effect I have lots of other suggestions put out of all I think it would be good to have different types of velocity edits and maybe new fonts that’s all I think cap cut is a really great app!
"Capcut is easy for most people, it is very easy to me but very hard at the same time capcut is so fun but sometimes it gets on my nerves because I have no storage and so far I’ve had to delete the app because I don’t have effects that I need. Like the velocity effect I don’t have it so I have to delete capcut and download it again which is SUPER annoying and not cool I sometimes think that I have to give up on editing but look at others edits and makes me not want yo quit I sometimes think editing is not for even for SOME people, so I far I hate this app but it’s good I guess I’ve I had to rate it I would rate it a 5,I’m giving it 2 stars."
"So first I downloaded CAPCUT I had it for a very long time I used it like once every week or whenever I wanted to edit… it started acting up out of no where and the app started shutting off so randomly and then I restarted the app and it would just be a black screen and wouldn’t load in the app. So I deleted CAPCUT and tried to reinstall it after a long time, and it says it’s still loading from when I first pressed to install it.. like it’s not even downloading at all it’s just the circular loading spinning thing! Idk what to do and I really want to edit CAPCUT please help!"
"I’m not sure if it’s happening for anyone else but whenever I try to use more than two key frames, it starts moving on its own! Very frustrating, especially as I need to use key frames, because I like to animate danganronpa sprites and makes it impossible! But I couldn’t figure out how to use alight motion lol 😅😅 I love the stickers and how simple the design is, it’s so easy to use and navigate, very easy and good for beginners and pros alike! CapCut, you have my respect."
"I think it’s great, I’ve used many other apps like After effect, video star, and premier pro but CapCut was the easiest to learn and use. My only complaint is there aren’t great text setting like After Effects has great text features, and that’s something cap cut lacks. Adding velocity would be amazing because that’s like the only reason I pay for video star and if you added that then this app would be on top!! So overall amazing for beginners and great for experienced editors as well,"
"I love this app, their are many features, you can put effects on to your clips, and you can also use cool texts and fonts onto your video. But with that, today I found out that if you put a text onto your video, and you add another clip to the project, it will say tap to add text on the screen. Which is very annoying because I wasn’t able to even take it off the screen, it would just stay there. So please fix this capcut!"
"I love this app so so much, I’ve made so many good montages, video edits, and even AMV’s. But recently, I was deleting some old projects to free some storage and I accidentally deleted a project I had been working on for a few weeks. Please, add a recovery system. Preferably ( for simplicity sake ) in Apple style. You delete something, if goes to the garbage but it stays in that “tin” for a week or so unless you clear it immediately. Whilst projects are in the “tin” you can recover them. I and many more would love to see this. Thank you, bye."
So I really like editing from this app but it always says couldn’t import even when I delete a few apps it still says that please respond I just wanna make edits it’s nicer then my other ones it’s just that import thing PicsArt or InShot doesn’t do that even peachy so please get rid of that and it never lets me do it and it’s annoying when I join I always have to delete a app I’m not downloading another app so please fix this and everything else is fine sorry this was my feedback but your app is good besides
"Ok so I absolutely love CapCut but there is a few suggestions 1. I get that it takes room but it takes so much room on my iPad that I have to delete a lot of apps and edits I worked hard on. 2. It would be a cool idea if you added a thing to help with roblox content (I know it’s not ideal but it would help a handful of users) 

But also I love this app I would for sure recommend and it’s super easy to use, completely free, so many cool filters and helps you with tutorials on how to use stuff! ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅso overAll just a few suggestions!"
"I give 5 stars but there is bug, when you adjust rotation of key frame, it went wrong than I wanted, I raged few times just now, please fix this bug, thank you! Btw, from shine! Edit: if you read this, please fix this bug once again! Thank you so much. Edit 2: ugh I raged more just now, because of keyframes, I was trying to make cookie run kingdom fan made pull, I was so mad at keyframes so 4 stars now. Btw Thanks.
Edit 3: Ugh I give up now though I will hold keyframes until bug will fixed. Btw thanks again!"
I do not know what is wrong with the app I have the app TikTok on my phone and I see people talking about how good it is to make edits so I decided to download it to see for myself I decided to download this app two times in a row and when I wanted to make my edit it kept telling me that my storage was full I couldn’t believe it just because I have 15 photos and seven videos in the app Photos and I barely have any apps on my phone so I didn’t understand why it kept telling me that my storage is full I  do not know if the problem is the app or my phone but I just do not understand why it keeps telling me my storage is full when it’s not
"i absolutely love that this app is completely free and has no watermark!!! and is awesome quality, BUT, i would like it if you added some of the features that video star has. Like layers and a overlay option, and an option to were you place and arrow on where u want to move ur person/ object places and a feature to where u can add shapes and make the turns and edits more smooth and so it doesn’t look blocky and chunky, other than that the app is literally perfect"
This app is perfect for all your editing needs. I have been using it 24/7 because its so easy to edit with. If you like editing I recommend this app. I told my friend about this app and she was so surprised that this app is so good. She has been trying to find editing apps for her videos so I recommend this one her. She said this is that app that she would like to use from now on. I am so happy with all my videos so far. Thank you CapCut for this amazing experience with your app
"This app is great. Most to everything is free, no ads, and you can literally crop out the watermark. I have a few suggestions though..
Firstly, maybe some new transitions? I would totally be willing to pay a bit of cash for some new transitions.
And Secondly, key frames? Sort of odd, but it would def help out while editing.
I don’t have any more that comes to mind, but this app is awesome. You should download it! Super easy to use compared to VS. (no hate to them I just am very confused haha 😅)"
And I don't know what I don't know what I don't know how are the same thing that I was like a little bit more and the same time to get it is the best for a good night I love u know I love u know I love me a little more of the same time to get to be a little bit more than you know I was like I love me to get to get to be able to the I I was like I love me and the same I i in a i ii lol I don't know what I don't know what I don't know what I don't know
Okay so I love this app I can edit my videos really nicely and I love the transitions and effects it’s all really cool! But there’s something that really annoys me 😅 so when you put in your pictures then you import your audio when you go to put another picture in it always says that you have no photos.. so I have to refresh the app and load it again :P i need this to be fixed like ASAP because I will die or something because it’s really annoying having to refresh the app again- 😭😭😭
"Capcut is very helpful when editing. Prior to downloading Capcut, I had iMovie. I am pleasantly surprised on how much better Capcut is than iMovie. This is not at all saying iMovie is bad, its just not amazing when youre editing. Comparing the two, Capcut has stickers, text, transitions, and more. Imovie has text and transitions. In Capcut you can move around the text, in iMovie you can not. In Capcut their are stickers, in iMovie their arent. I hope this what helpful, please remember Capcut has filters from TikTok and is 100% free."
"(I’m using iPad Pro if it matters)Ok so I’m not gonna into details about how amazing this app is, but it truly is but every day I use this app and when I go in the app, there is this bug makes it flip horizontal (I mostly have it vertically) and sometimes I have screen lock on but it does that even without screen lock but the way I fix this going out of the app and going back in. It’s just kinda annoying just to get back out and in."
First of I love this app I have made so many videos it’s so easy to use. Many great filters and effects! And best of all it’s free but I like to say on thing for the audio I would love an recording option because I use SoundCloud for my music it and I would love to just record music and put it in with out extracting audio from a video cause that never ever loads. Other than that Amazing app and love to see more from you guys! Keep up the great work!
"I have been using CapCut for about 2 1/2 years and.. let’s just say it isn’t the best editing app out there. Yes, I know it’s a free editing app, but come on, there’s tons of free editing apps that are above average. Capcut has minor issues, but the one that annoys me the most is when ever I import a project, it makes my edit(s) offbeat, low-qualited, and choppy. I never experience these issues in-app whilst editing, but always when imported. I love this app so much and it has SO much potential (besides the constant bugs/glitches)."
"Ok so when i got capcut, i struggled for a couple minutes. But that was it, Capcut is such an easy app to edit it on!! And I recommend it to beginners, or even if you not a beginner!! I’ve made such good edits with it! The only thing i have to complain about is after i made some edits it said my storage was full and i had to delete some of my edits to make more. Could you pls fix that?? But other then that its a really great app!! Well whoevers reading this have a good day/night!!!"
"This app is AMAZING! Unlike other apps, you don’t need a subscription or anything else! I have been on it for a while and the edits turned out really great! This is just a tip so you don’t have to read the next part...

If you want your video to move a lot, press animation, choose [in,out,combo] once that is set, upload your video and add another animation of your choice. Keep following those two steps until you are happy with the result.

Thank you so much producer!!"
"I really like that everything’s free and you have a choice of watermark. I also really love that you can make it super fast. The thing I feel like needs some work is when I try to upload a certain sound to use it takes forever to load and when I try to restart it, that does nothing. The thing that bugs me is that it works for some sounds and not for others. Otherwise it is absolutely perfect and amazing"
"Ok at first I loved this app it has awesome effects and such, but I want to maybe suggest some things to add and talk about somethings to fix.

It would be cool if we could have a bigger music library because most of the sounds are basic and arent really that great. And also maybe allow longer video times other than just 15min limit ?? That would be awesome and lastly the app has been pretty sluggish not sure if there is a bug but it would be nice if editing would be smoother, i know these things take time but just thought i’d mention them! Thank you :)"
Cap cut is a good place to edit you can do text to speech and doing cool edits and videos and more but the problem is i made 3 cap cut videos and one was for my yt channel its how to make a root beer float thing then i was gonna make a edit it was good going fine but then i was gonna make another video and it said not enough memory please try deleting drafts or phone storage i deleted all my drafts except for the one i was making and deleted some apps and some photos and it still didnt work please fix this if this was not a problem it would be. A 5 stars
"this app is AMAZING for editing videos and adding audios. it is way easier than any other video editing app/program and it’s free to use for all features! there is no watermark and a variety of tools. there is no need to switch app to app to edit anything, it’s all here. i use this app to make edits for tiktok mostly, but you can use it for anything. the app is not the best for voice/music editing though. highly recommend getting this app!!"
"I’m not sure if this review will be seen or not. But I’ve been suing capcut for a while now. And I will say the app is really good. The quality is high and the no logo thing is pog. But one of the only problems I have with capcut is it’s transitions. We have a large variety of transitions to choose from of course, but as a serous editor who is broke, I think cooler transitions would be awesome! The transitions we have now get old and boring, snd sometimes they don’t even connect. We need transitions that are smooth and fresh. 

Another suggestion I have is... please give us more effects!!! Every update when we get more effects I’m honestly disappointed. I think it will be something cool but it’s never enough. We should have more coloring and glow effects. That would be perfect.

Also, can you please add an “effect intensity” feature? So we can control the opacity of an effect or something?

More shakes would be cool too.

That’s all for now! But if you see this than ty!"
"You’re probably asking “Why 4 stars only?” Well first of all the app was working fine for me for 7 months. But today I tried to make a mash up and then it said “CapCut requires access to the album for editing and saving videos.” And I was really confused because the app already had access to my saved videos. So I had to delete the whole app with 3,654 templates. And when I downloaded the app again it said the same thing! And that’s the ONLY reason I made this review so CapCut, please fix this 😒"
I do recommend this app it’s really fun and easy to make videos. Although here are some things I want to change and to make it better there should be no limit on overlays I was trying to make a vid for YT but it just didn’t work because there is a limit on how much overlays you use SO PLEASE FIX THAT!!!!!!!!!😖 also this app takes up a lot of space and so maybe you can change that I would rate this a 5 star but if things weren’t a problem it would be perfect 👍 👌😁🤩😍
"This app is great. I used to use iMovie but then I saw This. This is the best mobile video making app in my opinion. But there’s one thing that needs to change. I can’t copy the video I made, and put it on my google drive, or put it in my camera roll. Would you please add that. I want to be able to put it in a folder. And also, there needs to be a share button. I want to be able to share my beautiful creation. But I can’t. Please add these things, it’ll make things a lot easier"
"I have used this app before for my videos which CapCut helps a lot.  I also like that I can go to the sound option and choose some sounds that I have favorited on Tik tok.  But the problem is I only got to use it once and now I get an error saying I must connect to the internet when I am.  I would this error to be fix when you have the time, no rush.  Other than that though this app is good for beginners like me"
"This app has really helped me with my edits. It is such an easy way to add sounds,music, overlay, effects and more! All of the other apps I have tried are so confusing or you have to pay to use almost any of the filters. With CapCut I have never seen an add or any in app purchase option. I make Roblox edits to be specific. So if you are looking for an easy, no purchase editing app, CapCut is for you! If I could rate this 1,000,000 stars I absolutely would, thank you CapCut!"
Omg 😱 this is the app that I was looking for it has all the features and you don’t have to PAY FOR ANYTHING the biggest thing I like about this app is that you can REVOME BACKGROUND and add greenscreen in it simply amazing HOPE THIS APP DOSENT DISAPPOINT OR DISAPPEAR because if it does I am going to be very sad 😢 I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APP especially if your making gacha videos or you want to add green screen in any background that you have and have a hard time finding or you’re being frustrated
"CapCut made me feel like an editor, so far better to understand easier more then any other apps, these features I would like to see are More Transitions, and Cutsom Transitions, Custom Transitions in such as making you own very transitions, also if you do add this please make a separate tab for this because I want my customs transitions to be saved so I can use it next time. Thanks CapCut for making me feel good as an editor! 🎉🎊"
"So Literally Like 5 Minutes Ago CapCut just restarted when I pressed the app and now all of my edits and progress is gone and I’m very just at loss of words cause like.. I was very proud of my edits and I didn’t save them to my phone cause I don’t have ANY storage on my phone but besides that, the app is great and has a lot of good transitions and a LOT of fonts and colors! And I would 100% recommend CapCut it’s literally like the best editing app in my opinion coming from an editor this my favorite editing app I’ve ever used!🤍✨"
This is amazing but it could use a few things. Since my favorite animations are far from where the none place is already selected it would be nice to have a “frequently used” tab or “favorites” tab. Templates would also be a good thing but if you could add those two things the app would be perfect. And if your making a video not editing one it would be good too get rid of some of the lag but since this app is mostly for editing it’s ok for the last one to not be there
"Alright, I LOVE this app. But I have one request. You don’t have to, but I think it would be rlly cool!! Make accounts! I’m getting a new phone soon and I don’t wanna lose my edits. I’m rlly proud of them, and I want them to stay in the app. Now I know you can just save them. But I really want them to stay in CapCut, and I don’t wanna lose them in the app. But if y’all think it would ruin the app, it’s fine!! I just think it would be a really nice update.

Thanks for creating an amazing app!! <33"
Okay so when I first got cap cut I was so exited because it was everywhere I made a lot of my best videos with this and really helps I really like how there was a tutorial on everything and everything is easy! But one suggestion can you put music on videos like blinding lights by the weekend or bad guy bye Billie ellish just like real music if not I understand otherwise everything is perfect I recommend for beginner editors is great for edits as well 5/5
I’ve been using CapCut for about 5 months now AND ITS AMAZING it’s so easy to use and figure out it’s perfect for tiktok vids or other apps like Instagram I’m not sure I would recommend doing animations though I feel like that would be really hard. The animations for the pictures work great it’s overall a really good app. The one annoying part is that I have to clear up the cache all the time. But I do recommend to use this app. Sorry if my punctuation is off.
CapCut is an amazing editing app! It’s very high quality and pretty easy to work with! It’s probably my favorite editing app! Although it’s wonderful there is one small problem.. With the latest update (2.3.1) the icons at the bottom are more or less frozen. When I try tapping on them it does not work. I’m wondering if it’s a problem with my storage or something on my end or if it’s something on your end. I’m also wondering if it’s happening to anyone else. Please look into that! Thank you!
"So I have been using capcut for awhile now to make edits for anime characters and stuff. Let me just tell you this: it is literally sooo good! The fact that it has no watermark and all features are free is just awesome! The only thing that I would suggest adding is graphs so we can make our own transitions (don’t get me wrong, yalls premise transitions are beautiful!) and let us use keyframes for things like adjusting the exposure or saturation. Besides that, the app is literally flawless!"
"I got this app to made edits and it work out (PERFECT) for me! I have been looking for a app that has animations, and let you record your sound and have it in the video as a sound plus more! I gave this app a 5 star because it deserves it, and I would highly recommend this app! But.. there’s just one thing when I crop the video it kinda lags out but, they will probably fix that very soon but over all this app is (AMAZING)! I will use this app forever! 😌✨"
"I found CapCut a few months ago, and I think it’s a great editing app. I’m a beginner editor, and this app has definitely helped me improve a little bit. Although, I’m having problems with the audio/sound. It’s not showing all of the audios that I’ve favorited on tiktok, and I’m a bit frustrated with this because I was going to use some of those audios for edits. If there is anything you could do to fix this, please do. Everything else works perfectly, though."
"i love capcut! it has some of the best features i have ever seen in an editing app! i 
just have a few minor suggestions.

1. maybe make it so that animations can go both ways, if you understand. sometimes i have an animation with a spin that goes left, but the smooth spin animation (spin) only starts out on the right. maybe you could make it so that animations could have multiple ways to go

2. more text animations. here’s the thing- text animations don’t have a wide range of things to do. maybe you could add some of the combo picture/video animations to the text one, because i would really like smoother in/out ones. also maybe make it so you could also add combo animations to text while in and out animations are present

thanks! hope you read this :D"
At first I was skeptical with this app just thinking it was another video editing app but long story short I’ve been getting into more video editing (I’m a rookie) but wow let me tell you this app is by far the best app I’ve downloaded!! None of that try a free trial everything is perfect unlimited editing and simple editing steps I’m still getting the hang of editing my videos more but wow this app does wonders let me tell you that !! Please never stop making this app lol
"Honestly, CapCut is great and super easy to use once you get the hang of it. It’s very organized and everything makes sense unlike other editing apps. Great if you are just starting to edit. Some that that annoys me a LOT is that when you go to slow a clip down, the slowed clip just turns really glitchy and it makes whatever you are editing look bad. I really can’t think of anything else. If you are a beginner editor, I definitely recommend it."
"I really love this app I use it for every video edit, because of the awesome effects and great features. There is also no watermark as well and is amazing to use. One thing I wanted to suggest is the voice over. I have to hold the microphone button down in order to record my voice, which is annoying because I want a button to just press and record I don’t want to hold it down because I’m doing stuff while recording. Overall good app just hope they can add that."
"Hi! If you’re looking at my review to see if this app is good to download, I recommend to download, this app is way better than KineMaster, video star, etc. This app is free for everything! I’m very happy with this app, but I have a suggestion: Please add more video effects. If you add more video effects this app is a 10/10 app for editors like me. Thank you for reading, I recommend downloading this app as you have the ability to remove watermark, etc."
"Ok so you might think of capcut as a boring starter app but after you get some practice ITS SO GOOOOOD FOR FREE? I make roblox dancing edits and they usually turn out so good. But the reason I’m making this comment is because I have a suggestion.. 
can you please make folders like you can hold one of ur edits and hold it on another and it makes a folder that you can add more videos for! I really want to put my favorite and unfinished edits somewhere because it’s really messy right now. But that’s it so byeeee"
"This app is amazing! But the only problem is that when I try to make new videos, it says, “Insufficient storage.” I always end up offloading some apps with storage and kinda deleted a few photos. There are no other apps that I don’t need because I need all of them. I actually do. And whenever I reinstall an offloaded app, it would sometimes say, “Unable to install.” So I would really appreciate it if you can do something about that. But, overall, it’s a great app."
"I don’t normally review apps but this is by far the best editing app ever, there are some things I can suggest though and this one is very important. Please add a make your own color option for overlays in stock photos. It will really help! Overall there aren’t many bugs and the app is really good at edits. One bug that MUST be fixed though is the stickers, the stars exploding an things like that get cut off in a box which makes it look very weird"
"i love this app, its a very nice editing app for beginners, but. i tried to make a edit today, and i took time picking photos out, and i got very upset because it took awhile to pick out these photos, and it said it couldn't import. I checked my wifi several times, and i knew there was nothing wrong with my wifi, even though it said it was because of my wifi, it also happened for my friend, where it said the photos couldn't import and said poor connection. Please fix this issue. I know this is not just me."
"This app is really nice when it comes to editing, especially if you’re new to all of it. I spent 4-5 DAYS on a project, got it close to being done, and then I accidentally deleted it while trying to delete another video I didn’t need. The whole project, GONE. There is no way for me to recover it, no way to fix it, nothing. I had so much in that project, and now it’s gone since there is no way to recover deleted projects. 

There’s many others who are having this problem, why can’t you guys give us the recover video option? I’m so upset now, and about to toss this app in the trash."
I just wanted to say that it’s very annoying and disappointing that you cannot undo the careless mistake of deleting an edit. I ask that you at least wait a week to officially delete it forever and have trash icon tab with the edit being able to be recovered. I spent a lot of time on and edit and made this mistake with not much in mind because most editing apps have this feature. I really hope you get back and are able to help me recover it. Please I really loved this edit.
"I love this app, I use it all the time to make edits and I have been using it for 4 years. Great to make animations. But if it had an easier turn, to turn and move things. I would be more happy. And for some reason, it became very glitchy, and started to move things by itself when I was trying to move it. Like, when I would move it one way, it would move the other way, it’s almost like another person is trying to move it. But overall, it’s a good app. 👍"
"Do not get me wrong but CapCut is my most used app for my edits! It’s a really good app and it is amazing for beginners but there is a bug that I’ve had. Whenever I try to remove background of an overlay, the other overlay stays with the same form as the first one. This is very annoying and I would suggest you guys please fix this bug. Although this is a really good app and I think that you guys are amazing!"
"If you would like a free app that grants you access to so many resources, then this is the one for you. I have been using app for about 2 years now and it is by far the best free mobile editing app. I love all the abundant features that always seem to get bigger with every update. This app is extremely user friendly unlike other editing apps. So if you want to make great videos, then you found your app. 😍😁☺️"
I have used this app for a long time to make edits. But all of a sudden it said I couldn’t edit stuff because it didn’t have access to photos. So I went to where I usually allow apps to access photos and the camera or whatever but it wasn’t there. All it had that I could allow access too was Siri and cellular data. I tried to look to see what else could be the problem but I couldn’t find anything else wrong. I haven’t been able to use the app. Then I knew it would probably delete my edits but I didn’t care anymore and deleted the app and redownloaded it. Now I just have CapCut and can’t do anything on it.
"I love capcut! It’s really easy to use once you get the hang of it and I’ve been able to make high quality videos, but I have on suggestion/complaint. When I use the overlays and add keyframes  I find it really difficult to rotate the overlay, so maybe you could fix this somehow because when I rotate the overlay it gets bigger and goes all over the place. Maybe I just haven’t figured the right technique out, but it sometimes gets really frustrating."
"I love this editing app so much, but there’s some issues I have a limit on how much videos I have saved and that’s a little problem. I have right now one video saved and says I have no more storage and memory, and don’t know how to fix that. I deleted all my saved videos and it’s still not working, I was wondering if y’all could fix that or if it is they’ll me how to fix it. This app is a very good app totally free no watermark or anything, it just needs some fixes."
So I just wanted to say don’t change like other creators for example video leap used to be free in all kind of way since I don’t have any star for example I would use it instead of Video Star because I could do overlays and stuff and now since the app blew up they want to make everything cost money that’s why I deleted it and give it zero stars that why I love CapCut they don’t change when they get famous
First of all the app glitches and it won’t let you put your audio on the thing the app tracks your storage so when it says storage full up you got a upgrade your storage because the app and you can’t even make anything because that and it’s terrible it’s not even that high quality like video start or any other editing apps and The updates are terrible and in general the app is just just not as high-quality as video star and other high-quality editing apps so to wrap all this up since this is a short little message to capcut this is one of the worst editing apps I’ve been on a long time don’t waste my time anymore
"I recently got this app after my friend recommended it to me, and it personally works great for me! It’s really easy to get the hang of, and simple enough to understand the basic functions without a tutorial. Sometimes if I’m sending it, it might lag a little, but other than that it’s perfect! It’s easy to use, as well! I never took the tutorial, but it was relatively simple to figure out. It’s a very helpful app and I really enjoy using it!"
"I loved this app compared to many other editing apps. It’s all free, and there’s no cheap deals as many other editing apps like to add subscription and premium fees for us mobile editors. Recently I have been working on an edit, and as I put in my clip from camera roll, I notice when my clip finishes it freezes until the second clip I put in is almost finished, making it look laggy. I’ve tried changing clips, rearranging, and even deleting a project to get rid of this problem, but nothing is working. There’s no update for the app right now and it seems like I’ll have to call the edit off. Very unfortunate and I sincerely hope this can get fixed."
"this app is REALLLY good all the features, transitions EVERYTHING are good. I love to edit on this app, and as i start adding transitions or even split and make a video shorter it starts to lag and the audio glitches and it gets very frustrating. For example video star, i could do anything on there and it wouldn’t get laggy or glitch at all. I would love to expect that from this app too!! Other than that this app is good and more people should try it out."
"I love this app to use the bottom of my heart and I will say why first, it’s free and there’s little to no adds. It has loads of effects including things like superhero effects to camera lens to shadows. You can over lay videos and and there’s a great selection of stock videos. So to the creator of this app: great job. But my only request is that you add a green screen setting. This way you could well, use a green screen in your videos. Thanks"
So I always use this app and it’s a perfect app no ads no monthly fee but the only problem is sometimes it’s hanging like today it hang when I tap one of draft project beacuse I did not finished it and it did not work so please help me it’s beacuse of the new update and can you please add more animation beacuse I love your animation and the transitions thank you hope you fix some things but after all it’s my favorite editing app
The app is awesome but sometimes when I add a certain effect is freezes the edit. I also think you should be able to see other people’s edits but make a option to make them public or private I would also like it if you could make a it to were you can look up a song and put it as the audio. Your app is great I use it so much and I make some really good edit
"I started using this instead of another app a few months ago. It has some great effects, text options, filters, etc. but the lag when making an edit is starting to get to me. The clips always lag behind when I’m close to finishing an edit and it makes it hard to judge whether or not the clips match up with the audio or not. There’s other people that are having this problem as well and if this doesn’t get fixed I am switching to another app."
This is a really great app for beginners. The affects are really good and amazing. All I would like tho is that maybe capcut could add better velocity and more grand and cool animation although the animation is already good I would love to see more cool thing u can add in edits. Another thing: the chroma key works well sometimes but I still see that bg. So maybe if capcut could fix that a hit it would be awesome. Overall this app is amazing and wonderful! I recommend getting this app.
CapCut is good thing to edit videos with and I make Gacha and random edit also I love were you can import sound from videos. And the sound it comes with are pretty good. They add more when the updates happen. I got a while ago on my old phone. I got a new phone bc I dropped mine in the toilet. Also the is a thing that you can add or not is the songs on the radio and your phone instead the music on the app now
"I live Capcut you can discover new things . It’s so easy and is NOT confusing , the first day I started using Capcut just in a snap I understood everything! I’m never gonna stop using cap cut. Unlike some other editing apps Capcut is the easiest (TO ME) I recommend to use Capcut for editing! But like when you add an animation to the text sometimes it changes the letter of a word you typed. Idk if this is a prob of mine or anyone eles. But I highly recommend Capcut!"
"This app is amazing it lets me do things that other editing apps can’t like key frames, and lighting and more,but there is a problem. See when I save the video to my photos and play it back to me, the animation is out of sync to the audio or beat. I thought it was my phone but i tried everything and it still would be out of sync, so if this is your app that is doing it I would appreciate it if you could fix it but besides that it’s a really good app."
"I’ve downloaded this app yesterday and tried to use it today but when I was working with the app I realized that it’s showing a false error. The app was saying that you’re not connected to internet but I was connected so I thought maybe my internet it’s not working I changed to sim card data but still the same thing. I hope you read this and fix the problem. 

Since I can see no one is reading and fixing then I don’t care bruh🤢🤢🤮"
"Normally I wouldn’t write reviews for apps like these but I need to talk about the app. First of all I wanted to say that it’s free! And it works just as nicely as your average editing app. It’s also very easy to upload your photos, videos and audio. Plus you can remove the ending (which basically the watermark) for free. The transitions are very easy to put in to. So let’s just say CapCut is your average editing app but like I said for free."
"I have been editing on this app for months now I would like to say it’s amazing. It’s amazing for beginners too. CapCut gives updates once in a while, not too long. I have improved so much since I started editing and I will not be leaving CapCut any sooner at the current moment. Simply if you tired of using the same old things on it then try and make your own stuff on the app. It’s make of creativity."
"Over all this app is great. I have only one problem. I feel as if there should be more voice effects. Like maybe they could make you sound Australian or Russian. I think it would be cool to have voice effects like that. But like it would sound realistic. So creators of CapCut, if you could add these voice effects this app would be PERFECT for me. ( not that it isn’t already awesome cause it is ) So please add these effects. Thanks!!!!"
"I love the app and it makes editing super easy but for whatever reason, every time I use the app now when I try to use a sound it says “internet not connected”. I’ve tried everything: restarting internet, disconnecting and reconnecting and the only thing that works is deleting and reinstalling the app. This technique works for editing ONE video and as soon as it’s done, back to no internet connection. Haven’t been able to find a fix online and it’s such a pain to have to continuously reinstall."
"Its a really amazing app, its really cool and stuff . but i think y’all should add better keyframes, graphs , and let us make our own transitions . i really enjoy editing on CapCut, but i’m tired of using the same transitions , and when i mix the transitions it doesn’t even look right . it should also let us save our data, because i had a very cool Shikamaru Nara edit , that i really liked. and capcut was deleted off my phone & when i redownloaded it i was mad that i didn’t have my edit . + capcut editors get bullied alot for using capcut . that’s another reason why y’all should add the things i said . please do:)."
I love this app so much. It is so much fun to use. But the only problem is is that it keeps saying my storage is full. I deleted 200 photos and 19 videos and it still says I need to free up more space for a 22 second video. Please fix this. I really think this is a good app for editing. I was trying to make something for my friend but I can’t because apparently my storage is full. Idk if it’s just me or not but please if you can fix this I really don’t want to loose hours of work.
I absolutely love this app because it’s FREE!! The only thing I would like to recommend is be able to name the audios that we import from our phone so we don’t lose track to which is which. Please take this into consideration and I would like to thank you for making an editing app that is 100% free ❤️! Edit: I wish I could log in so no process would be lost if anything was to happen to my electronic :((
"When I started making edits, I would download a bunch of editing apps but the annoying part of it was that I had to pay to either use an effect or filter. When I found CapCut- it was amazing. There were more filters/effects/transitions than all the editing apps I had before combined. Plus with CapCut, you don’t have to pay for anything that you want to use. I’m still new to CapCut but overall I really love it. :)"
"I absolutely love this app and you can make many amazing things with it i just have one problem that happens recently, the style button *3d cube* is just gone it literally disappeared so I can’t make a velocity edit anymore and I’m not the only one having this problem other people have been posting about it recently so now I can’t make my edit which makes me pretty mad I hope this gets fixed very soon but other than that LITERALLY AN AMAZING APP I LOVE IT SO MUCH CHEFS KISS MWAH"
I have been using CapCut for the the longest because it’s such a great app! No watermark the editing skills are great and everything! but the only problem is that recently every time I hit split and then I want to add a cool effect on it the effect doesn’t work like I try to set the duration but it’s not working I’m about to delete CapCut and then download it again but other than that it’s a great app definitely recommend!
Hey capcut I’ve been using your app for a while been making edit videos and stuff love the app honestly but anyways all of sudden yesterday it’s not letting me use no effects or different text and other things and it’s saying I have no internet connection when I Ik clearly connect can you please help me out cuz I tried offloading the app didn’t work and I even went to deleting it erasing all my stuff still didn’t work please help
"This app is amazing for editing videos , and cutting down videos ! I honestly think it’s great except for when things are unavailable according to different things that I do, such as the shortcut, when I click something it might say unavailable but other than that I love this app! 10/10 you should definitely download if your interested in editing videos or even making them!"
So I’ve been using CapCut for a couple years and I decided I wanted to make TikTok videos so I favorite some songs and it didn’t let me use them either said that there is no Internet or that I have no favorite songs or that there just an error so I was just wondering if you could fix this? Because I’ve been having some trouble making my videos recently so I was just wondering if you could see what was happening with that.
So I love CapCut but you’re starting to be this issue where if I try to import a picture it won’t let me so I’ve always been checking my Internet whenever it doesn’t let me and my internets completely fine so if you can fix that or maybe just tell me if it’s my Internet and there’s something wrong with it please do because I really wanted to be fixed so I can continue making edits because it’s very hard to make edits when you can’t import the pictures because I like making funny edits
At first I didn't know how to edit with this app but later on I became a pro but then after a while for some reason when I opened the app and tried to make a new project it said that I need enough storage. Then I cleared so much stuff off my device and when I opened it again it still says I need storage even though I cleared so much stuff. I even deleted more then 200 photos but it still says I need storage 😑. Should I just delete the whole app? So I rate this 4 stars.
"This is a great video making app better than kine master BUT and this is big it has so much bugs 1. When you make clips to short it freezes to another photo that is close or something like that, as a gacha video maker I get annoyed wit this.. 2. Whenever I need to try and edit the photo or clip it won’t let me it will get me to the animation into another photo or clip! Even when it’s not to short! 3. It dosent show a photo or video even when I got enough storage! Honestly this app pretty much annoys me."
"I honestly love capcut, it’s free u can create a lot of stuff, when I first started it was pretty hard I’m not gonna lie, but I started getting used to using it, I mean when u start editing u get used to it and it’s really easy a lot of effects and flash and text and more I think this app is really cool vsp is nice to but the thing is I hate how u have to but some effects and other stuff but otherwise it’s pretty I guess but I perfer capcut but I still like vsp ."
This app is amazing I am an editor in tiktok I have many followers but my only problem is the quality it is blurry but besides that it is amazing it have great transitions and the effects are great I recommend it and my tiktok is : bloody_h3ll so come check it out if you don’t believe me. also everything is great no subscription or anything unlike video star so if your a beginner editor I recommend this anyways bye!!!!!!!
"Capcut was a good app. Today I wanted to make a video with green screen. Since the green screen moved I had to use keyframes. Unfortunately whenever I’d use the keyframes, sometimes it would be hard to scale or move the images. And then when I would review the animation I made from the keyframes. The photo would end up in a totally different place. Please fix this bug, if it is a bug.

Nevermind, disregard what I had said, I found a different way to animate it. Thanks and sorry!"
"When i went to college I didn’t bring my pc and sought out a way to edit on my phone. This app is the closest thing you will get to Adobe After Effects on a phone. I absolutely fell in love with it and it allows me to edit my videos simply,smoothly and fast the only down side about this app is they have taken features like apply to all on resize and made it so you must watch an add before using it. It was not always like this and has become The main contributor to me looking for other editing options."
"The app is great because it has more things for editing and u can make ur edits beautiful! 

Edit: these here is a feature I would like capcut to add

 When ur doing the tweeting on the things ur doing u can make mistakes by making it big or turned the wrong way, please add a bullet point so u can turn it perfectly, and make it have the same exact big-small box like flipaclip when using the rope"
"I’m a beginner at editing and let me tell you, this app was really great! I’m really glad that the transition thingys are free, and not cost like 99$ lol. There is one problem though. It’s quite hard to explain it though, so i’ll do an example. Like, maybe you’re almost finished with an edit but you just need one more photo. But suddenly, it says that there’s no pictures i’m able to put in my edit. Fix it if you want, idc but this app is really good! Would recommend to beginners"
This app is great but I have some thoughts. One I would love if you could make a green mask transition for us. Also I would like more bling effects. Plus the retro style is amazing i it would be great if you could add more. And the stickers. I don’t use much of them BC I don’t really like them. Like it could be cute to use a little cactus or something else. Oh and extracted sounds is probably the best idea I’ve ever seen.
"Constant updates +  features are provided for free. The numerous effects/stickers are one of the best features in this app as well. Never had an issue with crashes or saving either.

For simple stuff, this app works fine alone. For a more serious project, you can use a combo of free mobile video editors and still get the job done. It might not satisfy you in the future but if the devs keep updating, I’m keen to see what’s added next."
"When I first looked at the reviews made by other people I thought maybe I shouldn’t download CapCut, but I decided to give it a try. I have a school project that I have to do, which requires taking a video. One of my classmates suggested this app for editing videos.  When I looked at the app & made one video I started to 💗it! So for those of u who think maybe u shouldn’t download it, give it a try & maybe you’ll like CapCut as much as I do."
Ok so ima a person who likes to edit alot and makes some anime edits but I need the velocity option like on style but I can't find the style button - I had it on a video but it's gone now- idk if you add it if there's a new feature to it or it's a big or it just does that idk- but I really really want that style button back plzzzzz also the app is very easy to use and it's good for editing and edits 👍^^ just plz answer my question ☠️😭
CapCut is a good app and I love it! But please fix this problem I’m having when I use the speed option where there’s a slider to what speed you want when I want the speed to be 3.0x it automatically changes to a different speed for example 1.0x and when I try to change it back it just goes back to 1.0x please fix this i have deleted and reinstalled the app many times but it doesn’t change please fix this problem
"I first heard about CapCut when the 3d Zoom effect or whatever was popular on TikTok, and I wanted to try it for myself and it was pretty cool. I then checked out all the other stuff you could do on it, now I love using the App to edit all the videos I make. (I make Football Edits) 

Thank You to whoever made this 🙏

Another thing that makes it great, is that it’s free and has amazing things you can use on your videos."
"this app is amazing! i like that there are no watermarks and everything is free. there would be some features i would like to added. there are no formats so we need to get a picture/screenshot as the format. it would be easier if we had an option where we can choose our format. there are many transitions or animations that are hard to find. it would be nice to add a search bar for them. in addition to that, graphs would be very helpful. next, when we add animations, we should put it where we want (i’m not good at wording). i want to put the animation at a certain segment. i’m really bad at making transitions so maybe you could also put the animation in the the transition option between the pictures/videos. it would be very helpful! other than that this is a great app!"
"I love this app it is Amazing 🤩 I have some ideas and suggestions for you 1. Recording in the app, I think you should be able to record in the app and use filters on you while you are recording 2. Drawing and erasing parts of the video 3. Creating your own template 4. Photo editing in the app. You guys do an amazing 🤩 job and I love this app because it is easy, quick, fun, and Free Thanks for making this Amazing 😻 app"
"I’ve used CapCut for as long as I can remember; but for some reason when I click in on the new graphs button the little box appears at the bottom of my screen but there’s a grey tint over everything so I can’t click on it, and it says “use graphs to customize transitions between key frames”; if there’s any way you can help that would be appreciated!! And keep up the good work!"
"If I was to give this reviews a few days ago, I would’ve given it a 5/5. This app is everything I looked for in an editing program. But that was the past.

Accidentally deleted an edit I was making because the way CapCut sorts your edits based on most recently opened, and not tweaked with. So, when checking to see which one needed to be deleted to “mAke MOrE rOOm” (another problem this app has), I unintentionally got rid of something I was making. 

There is no recently deleted folder within the app, and I reached out to support more than a week ago, and have gotten no response. Not even a yes or no. Just flat out ignoring my email."
"This app is amazing! My sister showed it to me, I don’t really like change to much but this app is worth it! I’ve tried countless of other apps and none of them are as good as CapCut! 

Reason to download: Completely free, a watermark is optional, great quality, very easy to use, and it’s just overall great!

At times it will bug but it is very rare that it will mess up, which is honestly so nice! And CapCut is even good for beginners because it is very easy to use! Yes, it may be hard to learn at first but everything is! From my experience CapCut is one of the simplest editing apps to use it’s great for all types of editing! 

I hope you consider at least trying out CapCut and if you don’t get it try and watch a tutorial somewhere it is definitely worth it!

"This is by far the best editing app I have ever used, it barely has any ads so much transitions and it's overall amazing! you should really download, as it is very easy to get a hold of the controls and l to understand them. It only took me a few minutes, and the longer you use and explore it, you can find such cool features and make great edits! It it also doesn't leave a watermark and there's no subscription."
For me personally i love capcut for my roblox editing videos. There is only one thing i would enjoy if they added. I really think you should add green screen option because it kinda hard for me to edit with green screen and i have to go to other editing apps which are a lot more complicating and difficult to use in my opinion. After all Capcut is the most convenient and easy editing app to use.
"So, I like this app it really does seem professional. It is a really cool and fun app to use. But, I was in the middle of making an edit when every time I would try to put an effect it said my connection was not working. So, I kept leaving the app checking my internet. When I finally when't back in to the app all my edited videos were gone including the edit I was making. It still continued to say no internet. This is VERY frustrating and I don’t mean to sound like a mean person but it is."
I love almost everything about capcut! Just on request could you please add the electric boarder outline that’s my only request other then that it’s all amazing!! All lot other people also like it so I was hoping you could add it back and again everything on there is amazing and this is perfect for beginners especially with all the free choices so I’m hoping you can add it back!! Thank you!
"I love this app and have been using it for a while! i just have one thing, can you make it so there isnt a limit to overlays? Thats ok if not. And, its always saying my storage is full! I delete so much pictures and it still says it. I even delete edits i kinda liked, but thats still not enough. Can you fix it? I really like this. Otherwise, this is a great editing app! Would recommend"
"Cap cut is really nice and helpful for when I try editing songs for videos, I do have some things that confuse me though. 1, I heard that there was a button that you can turn up/down the vocals or music yet I never found it. 2, I was actually thinking that it would be cool if we were able to combine music together so we can experiment. And lastly, I just am glad ya’ll have the “don’t lock your screen’ and stuff but what if you like- have to go do something and it turns off automatically?"
"This app is incredible. The fact that this app has any review less than 5 stars is crazy. My guess is that they are possibly next level editors and expected more from an app that’s free. I began my editing on this app and so far I’m very happy. No ads, no pop ups no nonsense. I’ve made some pretty cool content for my Instagram and made funny videos for my friends. It’s great already and any updates to it is just icing on the cake."
The stock photos were so much storage that it made my phone go to 4GB and so then I tried deleting stuff and it glitched my storage saying I wasn’t deleting when I was. I think there should be a place where you can recover permanently deleted or to be deleted projects. I was working very hard on an edit and couldn’t go back into the app bc of the storage and so I had to delete the app and I lost everything. There should be a place when you delete the app you can recover your stuff. Please fix this.
"I used to love and use cap cut, but now I don’t, I enjoyed making little edits with danganronpa characters and stuff, but now I can’t, I had to delete a lot of things, and despite that, it said I had “Insufficient storage. Clear up some more and try again.”, or something along those lines. I’m not sure why it does this, but I hope it stops because cap cut is really easy to use and I can make good edits with it"
"I love this app so much! But I have some suggestions such as, a graphs feature to go along with key frames. If you’ve seen a lot of editing apps have this, graphs would be an amazing edition to the app. Graphs basically control the speed of how fast the transition goes (ones that are presets). I’ll add on to this in the future, but graphs is really something I’d like to see added in the future! I have a lot of fun with this app :)"
"CapCut is a really amazing app to edit but I just have some suggestions for this app, for the animations, can you guys make the animations like video star transition like? I mean I love love the animations but I just wanna suggest like video star or ae transitions so it can be more like an editing app, the second one I suggest is that we need more stickerssss lol, and lastly, we need a thing where you save the video you edited and it has an option where you choose if you want it HD or not, that is all of my suggestions! Thank u!"
"Hi! I think your app in wonderful. I recently started editing and this app is a great way to start someone off. Though, I do have a suggestion to make this app even better. Could you try adding an account feature? I mean one where you could save all your projects on that account and continue on another device. Thank you for taking the time out to read this and I hope you have a great day/night!! 🤗🤗"
"CapCut is an amazing app for beginner editors and it doesn’t delete photos in your videos if you delete them on your Camera app (unlike Something master app). If you are a beginner go to this app for more editing skills and make a bunch of videos! So the reason I rated it 4 stars is because it’s overall amazing, but kind of getting boring like I would like some new effects and transitions and etc so hopefully the creator reads this and adds for stuff!"
"I’m a teacher and this year I’m going to, from time to time, need record lessons and messages for my students. I just bought a green screen and was looking for an app with a good chroma key feature. I tried Kinemaster, PowerDirector, and even iMovie. But none of them did what I needed. CapCut did EXACTLY what I was looking for. I don’t know how this app is FREE, but I’m not complaining!!! 🤣🤣🤣 A+ app that I HIGHLY recommend to everyone reading this review!!!"
I did a highlight reel of my football season with this app and it’s is so nice it had all the things I could ask for like slow mo reverse special effects such as an explosion fire and lightning different filters and other cool effects. So far this app is amazing and the best editing tool I have ever used. Theres also no ads and I didn’t crash once. Also all the features are completely FREE🤑🤑
Well when I was a beginner\my first time playing it was so easy you can go to effects and just have a good video. I would recommend for you to use this app I know they put a lot of work in to this app. And when I got this app I was vary impressed by all the work they put in to it . I found it off of TikTok And you can do like any thing on it. So that’s why you should get the app!
I use it up for many Gacha life videos I am a gotcha tuber and as being a YouTuber or a Gacha tuber guess this app is really easy to use for beginners I started using it a long time ago I’ve used it for about a couple years now and it’s really really really good! 10 out of 10 recommend it but that’s just my opinion if you look more in the ratings you may see horrible comments saying this is a horrible app:(
"So it’s good for beginner editing I have recently switched to a different editing platform because I want to grow my skills I have used a CapCut for at least 6 to 7 months it’s a really good app after all I connected it to my TikTok account and for some reason it would say no Internet connection even though I have three bars and then it would always say that and I had to delete the app and re-download it same thing with iTunes it shows up and doesn’t let me click on it, The app is overall fine!"
"This app is pretty awesome. I use it A LOT and make a bunch of really awesome edits. Here are some cons: Sometimes it doesn’t let you add photos. You have to close out, then go back in. Takes up a lot of storage. Pros: you can brag to your friends about your awesome edits. It lets you do a lot of stuff (velocity, key frames, animations, etc) for free! If your looking through the ratings to see if the app is any good, then trust me, download it right now!"
"I have used CapCut for a while now, and it didn’t take me a while to figure out what to do (like it the preview says “easy to use”)
But I just wanted to point out some bugs. (idk if the bugs are from  me or the app in general) 

Bug 1: I can’t explain it well but toward the end of my clip it won’t let me go any further as if the end of the video is there. (which it isn’t) I mean, you can stop it by getting rid of the tab and go back in but, it wold be nice if I didn’t do that.

Bug 2: no photos. I have photos, but sometime when I want to add some, it just says I have no photos. Like bug 1, just fix it by getting rid of the tab then going back in.

And that’s all I have to say really. But in general this app is great for beginners and I really do recommend it!"
"This is an amazing app for beginning editors! The animations, fuses between clips, effects, filters, etc. One thing that’s needs to be added is just a bit more voice effects such as auto tune, synth, etc. Just an overall tremendous app for editing, quick and easy, not to mention without having to pay a monthly fee for extra options unlike other apps I’ve seen and tried."
So i just started a new business and have tried several apps to help me create videos to advertise. Most of them are intimidating and difficult to use. I am not experienced in this field at all. This app is so user friendly. It has boosted my confidence and has made me want to learn more about video editing. The features are great and the app is well put together. I would definitely recommend this app. IT IS AMAZING AND I AM SO GLAD I FOUND IT!!!
"This app lets me take my edits into serious matter and helps me during a presentation in class/Work or with family. There are varieties of effects and materials to edit pictures or videos, I have been using this app for about I’m not sure 4-5 months now, and I highly recommend this app for anyone who wants to look into options and who enjoys taking the time to edit stuff for fun or work!!"
"This app is fine. For the most part it’s great, but the other half isn’t. Whenever I’m working on a huge project and try to make another video on capcut it says I have no storage left and I deleted over 100 photos and still have no storage. This app is horrible when it comes to that part. No other apps do that. Capcut isn’t reliable and I’ve been using it for a long time now. It’s getting worse. I also feel like the key frames should be smoother when it comes to remaking an edit. Can you please fix this. Other than that I absolutely love the app. I just hate when it comes to storage. It’s an absolute disaster. Thank you."
Ok 5 stars! BECAUSE THIS APP LIGIT SAVED MY LIFEEE 🦋☺️ soo I started a Tiktok acc (cloudychix) Witch Is a ✨FANPAGE✨ for Charli and Dixie 💕 so My Friend and i are the owners! And My friend uses “videostar” to edit witch I guess is good! But hard for me ☹️ Well I couldn’t Find an app so I started searching for one ☝️ and the first one the pops out is CapCut! So I Download IT and Bro Let Me tell You ☁️ This Saved my life! I made my first edit of Charli (idol) And it was so good I got so many view in Tiktok and I was so Suprised! ☺️ This app is amazing! I recommend It!
"This app is like... WOW. You don’t have to pay for anything, no ads, no premium, and the transitions are REALLY good. There are so many things you can do. There is no watermark, HECK, its ASKS yoy if you want to add the watermark, no payment. You can also grap audio’s from vids on your phone or use one of theirs which is really nice.I do t see any problems with it. If you are a person who likes to make edots of tv shows, people, or something like that, try this app."
"Do I have the newest update, yet I still can’t do the auto velocity. The option doesn’t even pop up. I have read the directions how to do it but it still never works. Even when I try to add a style for example “3D Zoom” it still doesn’t work. It always says “Can’t adjust current clip”. I have tried so many times yet it still does not work. And as I said yea I have the latest version. But everything else is fine."
"This app is overall amazing but we have one problem is that we can’t type any foreign letters, we obviously can in the typing bar, but it shows a totally different symbol as appeared in the screen, but the one in the typing bar stays the same. 
For example lets say English is a foreign language to Thai, we put the letter P in the typing bar, but as it appeared on the screen it’s a litter B. Get what im saying?"
"I absolutely love Capcut I edit and it’s soooo helpful but I have a slight problem when I add text then animation sometimes the animation doesn’t work, I will add it it works then I add another text and add it’s animation but then the first one doesn’t work besides from that I DEFINITELY recommend this app it has so many features and is so simple to understand, hopefully this small bug gets fixed and everything will be completely perfect"
"I love CapCut because I always use it to make edits, and it’s just really fun to play around with. One suggestion I have is that (I also make edit audios) if you could maybe add a feature where yon can muffle the sound of the music being used, that’d be awesome :) Like enough that you can hear it, but it’s muffled for the ✨aesthetics✨ lol it’s okay if not I understand but that’d be really cool to be able to do. Thanks!

-S"
"So I’ve been using this app for about 2 months now and I’m having a problem with it, every time I try to upload my tiktok music it just says “ no internet connection “ or if not that not even half of my sounds will pop up I always have to re down load the app when it says no internet connection. So if you could fix these issues thank you, but I’m very impressed by how easy this app is to work!"
"I LOVE Capcut! It’s easy & simple to use. It has a lot of great features that are outstanding even compared to more expensive computer applications. There’s only one feature that doesn’t match up with other apps, the speed changing operation. Unfortunately, the slow motion is anything but smooth and practically unusable for anything professional. This would make a 5 star review if the speed changing function were suitable."
Hii! I LOVE CapCut but there some cons and something you could add in my opinion. First off it’s a great editing app for people and it’s pretty easy to use. But when I want to upload a YT video (I do crop it to 16:9) but it turns out REAL small soo idk you know? Also here are some recommendations! First can you add where like you can add you installed fonts? Since I want to use this font called Cheri but I can’t download and put in CapCut! I think that’s all my recommendations for now! Awesome app btw!
How do use this app all the time it’s a really good app I love I will let you make your own edits I made an edit of my dog and he’s so cute and I love how you can add more than one sound when I was making that edit I accidentally ran out a sound so I looked and see if I could add another sound so I found a good sound and I added it in with it and it sounded so good at the end it looked so pretty and that’s why I gave this app a five Star rating!
"Capcut was like the app I actually downloaded and it was good but when I didn’t use it for a while :< I clicked on the vids I made and the thing pop up the screen and it said “ this project requires update note that this may consume cellular data” and I want to know why is it there I used the app like “2 apps” on it and how hard I work on the edits, so I may want to know why it keeps popping up in the screen and I really really want to see the edit of mine :("
"I have at least 4 editing apps and this one is the the best! You can add music and extract sounds! Overlay and effects! There is just one thing that is getting me frustrated. From time to time it will kick me out off the app. The progress is kinda saved, tho. It will kick me out when I’m trying to and an animation and when I go back in the animation isn’t there. If they fixed this glitch my rating would definitely be a 5 star. 
       Thanks for reading this!"
"Capcut, I don’t know if anyone else is having these problems but I know I am. I’m having to delete all of my edits because it takes up to much “space” and now I’m left with one video and it’s saying that it’s taking up to much space.
This is really getting on my nerves because I’m having to delete edits I’ve worked hard on and not finished, because of this."
A really great app but sadly it’s slightly laggy and considering that I use this app for editing and making videos if you put the speed too high they would lag and would be really glitchy going forward and if you put too much short layers it would just freeze. I get that it’s a free app with no logo and it’s not supposed to be great but it’s really annoying. I hope this feedback is somewhat noted. This for me besides that I would rate it a 5 or 4.9.
"I really love the app and all but I want to talk about one thing I hope you can fix. It’s about the overlays and effects. I want to put the effects on the overlays as if it was on the image etc. I’ve been trying to make it shake and flash but it ends up not doing it on the overlay and just doing it on the image. Please , I would love if you a second option to put the effects on the overlay. If someone can help me , I really don’t know if you can still do this."
"I have been ushering Capcut for several months now and I really enjoy how easy it is to navigate and use it but as I am progressing I wish some thing where more actuate like the volume section u can barely raise or lower the volume.😐I love the filters bcc they are nice and my style but I think that there sound be a little more than like 10,but overall this app is really good if u are new to editing but is u are Proish at editing u would look into getting something better"
"This app is great, it has so many high quality options to edit all the whole being free! Though it would be nice to have the function of splitting screen with two or more vids, some of the editing I want to do require this so I have to do it on a different app, which is a bit annoying but not a big deal I guess. It’s just nice to have everything in one app so it’d be fantastic if this function is added! Otherwise I’m very satisfied!"
"I use this for almost all vids and edits but the only downside is when using overlay, like green screen and such, it tends to move to a random spot in your video like not where you want it to, so it tends to be very annoying having to place it to its assigned spot in the video. And no, moving the overlay is not MY actions. Same goes for audio. I am kindly asking the creators to fix this and maybe I’ll give it fives stars like most of the others with the same issue."
"This app is amazing! We get to use everything on the app for free, and there’ no watermark. There is one problem though, so every time  I edit, and try to playback the audio is delayed and the sounds don’t sync up. But when you export it, all the sounds are in sync, and you can also just go back a little bit in the recording. So besides that problem, I think Viamaker is great!"
There’s just one thing with cap cut I love this app!!! It’s free and everything is free on the app! But just be careful because the one thing I hate about this app is there newest songs have the F WORD IN THEM!! and my 9 year old brother was using it and heard it!! They have a lot of the F words and S words in there newer songs so just be carful with this around younger kids and please change this cap cut because younger kids do use this!!!
"I want to get capcut on laptop or pc or other devices because I can't use a lots of videos and photos in Ipad or phone, even my ipad storage is full right now. In laptop we can use a lots of videos and photos as we want so please make quickly !! Also smooth slow motion really help me. I want more auto shakes, more effect, like AM and more animations of texts."
There… is a issue whenever I save a edit and want to make a new one it’s say I don’t have enough storage.. so I deleted the edits I made and see if it will work but it said the same thing then I went to photos and delete the ones I don’t need an then.. it said the same thing I deleted the app cuz I thought it was a glitch then I re download it.. same thing so now I don’t know how to edit if I deleted the edits in my photos can you pls fix this if you could?..
"Free, no watermark, powerful, easy to use… Sign me up!

Used this app for a couple of weeks/months now and its been amazing so far. Im not the best video editor so I dont know the full capabilities of this app, but i do know there is much more to it than I think.

Would love a pc version if possible but using it on a phone or tablet feel just about right… for now.

The people who worked of this app would make a killing porting it to windows 10 or mac. That been said it is alot more work but with the capabilities of pc its possible they can cram alot more features into it.

If you hadn’t noticed i would love a pc version. (Heres to hoping)

Anyway, if you’re on the fence about getting this app, you should… plain and simple"
CapCut is a pretty good app but when my storage gets fall I delete so many things and it still says I am not able to access it but overall it’s pretty good but maybe it could be just a little bit better because a lot of apps I see are pretty good but I’ve seen about maybe two of them that look better than that so maybe it just needs to add a tiny bit more
"So I use capcut for making edits, but here’s a problem I keep on running into, no matter how many times I reboot and/or delete then reinstall the app: whenever I try to choose an animation for a certain part, usually it displays how it’s gonna be, but now it’s blank and when I choose it, it loads, then it says “Connect to the internet and try again”."
"I’ve been editing for almost a year. I’ve tried various apps but never had found one with the effects I wanted for a good price. At least, until 10 minutes ago. I SERIOUSLY DOWNLOADED THE APP 10 MINUTES AGO AND IM ALREADY OBSESSED OVER IT! Tons of effects and stickers FOR FREE! With no watermark as well! It’s simple to use also. I immediately understood how to add photos and videos to the project. It’s incredible! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this app for any editor, new or advanced."
"I friend told me about this app and I thought it was a waste of time at first, but it Is amazing. There are layers, Its 100% free, and they have tons of transitions, stickers, and filters. Not to mention it has NO WATERMARK which I think is insane. The only problem is the audio/songs, it’s pretty bad quality but I usually use another editing app to add the audio and then I crop it. So it’s not really an issue with me! Overall 100% recommended"
I really love this app. The effects and all but recently it doesn’t let u download the effects which I found weird I thought it was only me but I texted my cousin and the same thing goes for her. And I don’t know what caused that to happen bc yesterday the app was working fine. I deleted and downloaded it again and I still got the same problem. Can you please fix this?
"So far, this app has been good to me. But sometimes it can be a bit buggy. for example, i was trying to edit a reaction video i made, but couldn’t play it back because it was so buggy. Every time i tried it would just do nothing at all. And I couldn’t extract audio because it wouldn’t show any of the buttons. Like i said, this app is very good and i totally recommend it for editing, but these bugs need to be fixed."
"I love using this editor so much, but there are a lot of glitches.. sometimes the audio doesn’t work when you cut it in half, sometimes when uploading a video it seems like the editing sometimes doesn’t catch every edit accurately, and when you try to zoom an image in or out it obnoxiously snaps inti a smaller image when i try to make it bigger."
I use this app ALL the time I love it so much!!! But also I had a recommendation that would make it much easier for some people that use this app. You should add where you can combine the animations that you guys already have in here! It would be really cool and could help out with things and make even more better creations! Please just take it into thought and think about it! Love this app❤️.
"It’s an very good editing app. It has lots of great affects, and it’s awesome! So, if you are going to use CapCut, here are some useful tips!
Tips: when you are going to put music in your video, do not use the voice one, unless you are going to do an voice over. Screen record the music, edit the music,  then  you can put the music.
And also you can there are music that CapCut put, you can also use that."
"This app is really great. I use it all the time, but there is a problem when I try to export my edit and it says I don’t have enough storage. Even when I try to delete other edits I have made it still will tell I don’t have enough storage. And now it will not even allow to view my edit when I tap on my edit it says I don’t have enough storage. This total ruins The app. If you see this then please fix that. Thanks!"
"I love cap cut I use it to edit, but maybe you can update it for us like maybe you can add this feature where we can add fonts we want bc sometimes I get tired of the e fonts we have and I want to add new fonts that I like if that’s okay, maybe you can add a new update where we can add fonts for people who have iOS and new animations for text but other than that CapCut is really good I recommend it 100%"
"I had made about 3 video edits before the storage went out, that might be my fault though- as many times I try to fix this it just doesn’t work. I was able to use any other editing app I had but this one just didn’t work anymore, sorry if I am just being stupid but this is just kinda annoying. Anyways with the whole problem this is a really good app for beginners and it’s easy to figure out what you need to do, I hope this was helpful in some way. 

Bye!"
"This app is Amazing! It has everthing that you could ever need! I use this app for insta and tiktok and get about 1k likes per vid, and all bye using this app! I really like it but some times to delays, for example I was doing an edit on a sound from tiktok, when I went to look at the edit that I made ON Capcut the sound we delayed, and yes i looked at it before but when I downloaded it to my camera roll it was delayed, but in conclusion this is a great app and y’all should use it"
"Hello capcut! I would like to say the the things that bother me! It would a Really nice if  you COULD stop saying""no internet connections, connect to the internet and try again.""That really bothers me and it would be nice if you put the app to where it doesn't need internet thank for reading my Review Thank and also please make it a lot easier to find Different effects Its really hard to fine some! Thank you! 🤍🖤"
idk if this is happening to other people but i was doing a gacha edit but the app kept crashing and i think it had something to do with the overlay i think it’s called because when i delete some of the overlays it works perfectly no glitches nothing but when i put more it gets very glitchy and breaks my game if you could fix this it would help me a lot and other people too if there having the same problem.
"In my opinion this app is better than any other edit app I’ve ever used, the way that it’s free, has no watermark, and even has transitions that don’t need you to get a free trail on them blows my mind ! The built in stickers to make a cool edit is what really caught my mind, I love it so much it took me a while to find a good edit app but this! This is it ! Please never remove this app from the App Store!"
"But there is a problem, every time I try to save a video it says insignificant storage, so I exit out of the app deleting 50 or more videos and photos and then I get back into the app and it still says the same thing and when I exit out of the app again to delete more videos and photos it says it again but this time when I press on the video I edited, it said insignificant storage again, I thought deleting the app and downloading it would fix it but it didn’t. I kept doing that and it wouldn’t stop doing that and now I have to use another persons phone to edit my videos and photos."
"So I saw this girl edit on this app,and I wanted to make an short and simple edit,and got some picture from google,and the effects are SOO GOOD,and I don’t have to spend money on after effects and because I don’t have a laptop,but anyways this app is amazing after all,my edit that I made for my sister who loves this website game called Friday night funkin,and made and edit of her favorite boy,and she loved it"
"freaking extraordinary. works extremely well. absolutely adore, especially because there isn’t a watermark. doesn’t lag for me as well. The only complaint is that I cut the video at the wrong time and now I cant go back. oops, might’ve just been my mistake. you can only undo what you have just done, and then back. other than that happening I’ve loved it so far."
"This app is such an amazing app with so many amazing affects, transitions and other abilities. However, I do find this app needing an update, For example the music cuts off so easily and it’s very hard to control the layers. I honestly think that they need a better music and I really hope that they add an update because there are a couple things that they could change. But I think that this is a strong editor and has amazing features!"
let me start off by saying i love this app. it’s super easy to use and it’s pretty good quality photos. i use the match cut often so i can synchronize transition to beat changes but i wish there was a way to have two or more colors. sometimes the constant yellows confuse me especially if i want to do like layers so that’s a suggestion for the next update maybe !
Hi! So I have been using CapCut for a month and I’m so addicted to it! IT HAS ANY FEATURE NO OTHER APP COULD HAVE!! There is no way this app can have hate my favorite parts are the effects stickers and text! And I love the new update! Capcut is the number one app anyone could use! It’s extremely easy 100% FREE!!! And ta cool free app with SO MANY GOOD FEATURES COULD BE ALL FREE!! If this app had in app purchases it would be WORTH EVERY PENNY !! Whoever is reading this PLEASE I BEG OF YOU DOWNLOAD CAPCUT AND SEE FOR YOURSELF!!! Thank you so much for this app!
"So usually I’ve been having issues with other editing apps & came upon this one, I really didn’t think of anything at first until I made a small music clip & let me tell you I was actually in shock that I made such thing. I would recommend anyone to use this app, if I still haven’t convinced you then at least give it a try & see how it goes. I promise you won’t regret it. <3"
"this app is amazing! I love it has no watermark, has filters, you can add your own sound and so much more! but I hope you can make a update to fix some bugs. it never really loads, whenever I close out of the project it saves but it doesn’t load all these mini pictures in my edit (if that makes sense). and so I keep hanging to redo it over and over again but sometimes I have to go and if the project doesn’t load I can’t finish it. please respond to this and please change this."
I absolutely love this app. Endless possibilities and power of creativity is literally at the fingertips of your hands. I used this app multiple times and I have enjoyed using editing software to make audio for my friends. But the update ruined that because most of the base boosted audio I had just stopped working and any other attempts to fix it just result. The bass boost is what really made me enjoy this app and now it feels a little less enjoyable without it. Please bring back the base boost.
"It’s a pretty good app! There’s somewhat a lot you can do and it’s fun (to me) to make stuff, although there is a low limit of layers that you can add which is ig lame? It would be more easier to make animations and edits that acquire more movement then normal, and the filters are really the best and are sort boring. And even if the cut was too ‘short’ It would be maybe a little nicer to have it so you can do it however short it is, it would be more helpful with animation, edits, mini movies, etc

So pretty much it would just be:
•have a higher limit of layers
•try to make the filters a little less boring
And •MAYBE make it so you can edit the movement type thing with it being however short it is

But it’s honestly a really good app for mini movies/episodes and small edits :)"
"So, this app is amazing! has great effects, easy to use, and its free. but theres one thing. it sometimes glitches, and says it need to allow it to use my camera and when i try to allow it, it doesnt even give an option to allow it! i then have to delete the app, redownload it, and wait a few hours to even do anything. which is annoying because then all my progress is lost. pleaseee fix this! ❤️"
"This app is the best editing app ever no watermark, everything is free, amazing transitions, and more... but there are so annoying parts like when you editing with photos for a gacha movie or skit when I click the photo it sends me to the transitions tab and it just gets me annoyed, it’s also laggy and it sometimes glitches so when I’m done editing I rewatch it to make sure everything is ok, and then it stays on a photo and I get frustrated. But over all this is an amazing app"
"Who in the world bothers to write reviews? 
I sure don't. If the app is bad, delete it. If the app is good, hold on to it. 
I have NOT ONCE in TEN years felt that an app was SO good, that I just HAD to write an honest review. 
I just feel like I shouldn't keep it a secret. 
So, I'm here to tell you all, this app will literally blow you away! 
It's free for starters, no gimmick no catch it's free. They may have premium options but to be honest I haven't noticed them. 
This app does EVERYTHING that you could possibly want to do with your video. 
I've made amazing high quality premium videos very quickly, very easily and for FREE. 
If your searching the App Store, just stop. Stop now and download this app. 
Thank me later."
"This app is amazing, 100% recommend this if your looking to edit. Love the transitions to it and all the stuff you can do. I looked at the reviews. You guys have to realize that it’s YOUR problem you don’t have enough storage, or YOUR problem you can’t take time to practice on a app. It’s not capcuts fault.

I just really wish this could have more transitions, and better text effects ^^"
"I will be trying to make a edit but when I go to get a picture or edit something on a different app it always freezes so I exit the app but then when I go back in says I don’t have enough storage on my phone but I do because I don’t have a lot of photos or tabs open so I do not understand why it’s not working. 

I’m not sure if this is a glitch or bug but I would like if you fixed it😅 

Thank you."
"I recently made a video and the video will come out lagged or behind its sound when while editing it was fine. I don’t know if it’s a bug or not because I usually don’t have problems exporting a video and it being the same as what I edited. But this time the effects are lagged and also the sound doesn’t match the video when in editing mode it is fine, will def change to 5stars when this gets fixed!"
"Hi ! the app is amazing but it does have its flaws, i’m an editor and it’s hard for me to export different fonts from different shows when you don’t have that option (hopefully that’ll come it the next update?) also the volume quality is great but it’s not loud enough or quiet enough when needed if that makes sense, i’m just hoping for exporting texts and different clips and better volume :)"
"Every time i want to make a edit but i want to use transitions or effects and anything else i use to make my edit, so i decided to log on a couple days ago and it said “No connection try again later” so i just thought it was a bug in the app so i decided to leave it but today it still wouldn’t work so i just deleted the app but still wouldn’t work so i was wondering if you guys could fix it?"
I am very pleased to have this app.  It is free and I’ve been seeing reviews everywhere about this app and I wanted to get it but I never had the time to download it.  When I first downloaded it it looked very easy to work. And I was right! I was very surprised on how I learned how to work this app in a matter of time ps: I am not very good at learning stuff like this.  I don’t have any complaints on this app. Hope you guys are hyped on editing on your new software... CapCut!
I’ve downloaded many apps like this before and they all are trash. Always asking me to buy a membership or some kind of vip but not this one. I haven’t gotten a single ad or annoying pop-ups asking to buy a membership. All the effects are really cool and the filters are the cherry on top. Super easy to use and great for beginner editors. Some of my best edits have come from this app.
"capcut is a very nice editing app, and is very easy, fun, simple to use. I’ve been using it for a few years and it upgraded a lot! Though, if you’re trying to learn how to edit still, I recommend don’t use to many effects that’ll make the vid not visible to see :)) I wouldn’t give it a 5/5 because sometimes, it’s really stresses me out cuz the vid lags alot when I add too many effects/overlays. it’s not rly capcuts fault tho. overall great app, recommend using!!"
"Very good app. Whenever I use it to edit, I get amazing edits. It’s just when I have to do my own velocity and not do the auto velocity, it gets a bit hard. Also when I try to get pictures, sometimes it says that I have no pictures and I have to open the app again so I can had a picture. The stickers are good that I have so many edits in mind, and so hard to pick! Very good stickers!"
"This is an overall awesome editing app however, I’m currently trying to overlay things to make tweeting but when I try to overlay 3 or more it will black screen and lag. This is really annoying when I’m trying to make and edit and I can’t fix it. But overall capcut is great and I love it because it’s easy to use unlike other complicated phone editing apps and I love the animations! Just this glitch is very annoying"
"I like it, it’s a very good app it’s just every time I go on it when I want to use some songs from TikTok it just says I need a internet connection when I have one so then I have to uninstall it every time for it to let me use my TikTok favorite sounds but on top of that is doesn’t show me my new favorite songs I add plz try to fix this it really irritates me and if it is fixed then I will add the one star that’s really the only reason I don’t have it at 5 stars"
"I been using capcut for some time now and I discovered some glitches that kinda annoy me. The first glitch is that when I want to put a photo it says I have no photos, it’s annoying. Second glitch is when I want to put a effect is glitches and does not put it on and it gets annoying when you have to do it over and over again, but overall it’s a really good app I recommend for beginners, etc ❤️"
"The way it looks makes it feels seem easy and easy to edit, I also love how the transitions make everything seem like the edit is better, The green screen tool is also amazing! and I love how you can add your own audio from you camera roll, and the stickers and effects make it better! and a lot of updates is just outstanding!! i love love this app!!! :)"
I love this editing app! I was looking for something to use to edit for a while now and found this! It helps me make so many videos super easily. I don’t think there is any glitches with the app that I know of. It has been a little laggy at times but I think that it’s just because of my internet. This app is great in my opinion. I think a beginning editor should try it!
everything is great on CapCut but there's one big flaw. it compresses the videos by a considerable amount  why it doesn’t give you an option to give the raw video instead of saving  space on. different editing software give you 4K 60 non compressed the Best it can give you 1080p 60 compressed. that’s why I switch my videos look so much better. I use alightmotion now it wayyy better
"The app is amazing, I was so glad it was free when I got it. But I have a problem. When trying to upload a video that’s 2 minutes, it doesn’t let me. It’s in my camera roll but will never pop up everytime I try to upload it. I wish you’d add a feature where you could upload videos over 2 minutes. It’s really a pain in the neck when I spent hours trying to make a video and I can’t put sound because the video of the sound is over two minutes."
Can you please fix this because I deleted a bunch of pictures and I wish I can get them back so basically when I try to edit a video or make a video it won’t let me I deleted a bunch of pictures and deleted it after and I am so frustrated because I really don’t understand what’s going on but I’m just gonna tell you this this is a good app but I really need something if you can fix this bug or is it?
"I love this app a lot!!! I had only a little experience in video editing and this app made it extremely simple to video edit. There are no watermarks, which I love, easy to use, and free! I use this app to edit videos and it’s very fun. I love how this app has easy-access transitions and I am able to understand it very easily. This app is so diverse with their transitions and effects, considering it’s free!!!! Keep up the good work, CapCut!!!"
"I use an IPad 7 for almost everything. I was trying to edit videos, I just downloaded the app it was working fine a few minutes in though it had started to glitch from me putting effects. I was making another video later on. I tried to import 30 photos and once I tried to continue It was loaded and then stop and my app froze."
"I love this app because I use iMovie (which is another editing software I use) and when I would try to add photos, the photos would move around. And then when I would edit it, it would stay in one place of the photo. But this app is amazing because it stands straight for the photos. And really easy to edit! You have a lot more options to use on CapCut! It helps me a lot with my YT channel🤩

         YT channel: Zoey The RAWR"
"okay I don’t write any reviews like ever. But it’s awesome and just want everyone (like me) who enjoys editing to have this🤩. I use it for all my edits, not rlly anything you can’t do on it, completely free. Highly recommend, even if u don’t like it you should at least download and mess around with it for a while. Thanks for reading! Also if you wanna check out some edits I’ve made with it go look at my tik tok: Offixial_adxi"
"I have been looking for an app to make edits for tiktok on, and let me tell you, this is the freaking app. It is easy to use, it has multiple layers (so you can put videos on videos), you can easily move the videos, it has free transitions (THE TRANSITIONS ARE SO COOL), and so much more. If you need an app for edits, this is it. 11/10 very good. No watermarks and you don’t have to pay for the good stuff. This is the only app I use for edits."
Okay so as an gachatuber this is amazing I can do anything that I want everything free it just amazing! You can delete the data! And save space! This editer is underrated there should be more people using it it’s amazing! To anyone who is interested in getting the editer get it! It absolutely amazing! But could you maybe do one thing for like stickers and stuff like overlays could you make it so that I like pops up maybe?
"I can’t believe it’s free and I’m surprised they’re still adding a few more more things. There is one problem tho it lags a bit and I can’t use the effects for some reason. If I try to use any effects I didn’t download it keeps on saying I’m offline when I’m literally in the same room as the WiFi router and my WiFi is on. Can you please fix this problem, I would really appreciate it"
"Hello I’m a beginner and it has very good quality editing options. since I am a beginner I am not very good at editing, but I do know for one thing that this app will help you very much and can I help you move on to other editing apps like kind master and video star. it is very good and I hope you all enjoy this App is ever his reading this🥰😌😊😍🙂☺️❤️💜🧡🖤💛🤍💚🤎💙❤️‍🔥❤️‍🩹❣️💕💞💓💖💘💝💟"
Ok so I love Capcut this app is AMAZING🤩 but recently the app has been lagy I don't know why.. Anyways like i said Capcut is amazing but something I would like in the app is motion blur😌I do edits and motion blur would me amazing 🤩 Just to clears some things up I know that the app has motion blur but it doesn't work very well In my personal opinion it makes the video you're editing blury... Othet then that Capcut is Great!🤩🤩🤩
"I’ve been using this app for all editing I’ve done!!!! LIKE I LOVE IT!!!! And it’s completely Free there are NO in app purchases I’ve seen! But there’s one issue so sometimes if you’re editing a clip you’ll try to add an overlay or another clip sometimes it’ll say you have no photos which I know is not true because I have like 2,000 photos on my tablet lol 😂 but yeah that’s really the only issue other than that I LOVE IT!"
"So, ever since my little cousin introduced me to CapCut, I was in love. I could make animations easier and everything! But when I signed into TikTok for sounds, some things went a bit wrong. It was not loading my fav sounds. But that’s fine, I definitely recommend for beginners like me and use your imagination to make all sorts of things! 5 stars :’D"
"So I downloaded this app because I wanted to make football edits and this app is perfect for it ! For someone like me who has never even attempted to make a edit this app made it so easy. But the one MAJOR PROBLEM, is that when I want to use a sound from my favorites or original sounds it always says no internet connection when i clearly have internet connection . Is there a way to fix this or no."
"I love capcus. And since I’m a new edited capcut is a very good app to start with, but there is one bad thing about it. The Quality I really just wish there was a better way to get better quality in my videos. So I hope that capcut can make that effortless way to get a better quality for my videos. But over all capcut is a really good editing app cause it’s very simple and you don’t have to use to much brain to figure out how to use capcut."
"I’ve had CapCut since August and I don’t if these things are ""new updates"" but one thing I noticed that changed was the volume when I replace a video. I personally don’t like how the volume turns on when I replace the video, and even though I have the volume muted. The next thing I noticed was that the text looks different when I turn on the shadow. Today the text opacity wouldn’t work either. I’m not sure if the first two are glitches but those are some things that have been bothering me."
"Ok this app is perfect just that it would be more perfect if you put music sounds like I was doing something but someone tell me that I can’t put music I just can put music recording the music so that makes me sad so if you can add like at least 3 popular song every month it will be awesome. Or if you already have this option of songs pls tall me I need this
Thanks for this app"
"First off, I would like to say thank you so much for giving us all the opportunities to edit like a pro this app has really help me have better editing skills but the only problem that lags is whenever I edit my videos I noticed that the transition don't go along with the beat of the song but it'll catch up overall this app is truly the best thing EVER KEEP 👏🏽IT 👏🏽UP👏🏽😤🔥💗"
Hello I want to thank you so much for creating this app cause it helps me make a gacha video like the gachatuber I am not one of them cause mom won’t let me but If I did I will always going to be using this app cause a lot of gachatuber use this app and use the text to speech so we won’t be reading long thing and I love how it can read it for you thank you so much CapCut I love your app so much
This is a really good app it’s just that when you have to get a new phone or get it fix where you have to restart your phone from the beginning your edits get deleted. So I think it’s best if you guys make it where you have to long into a account that keeps your edits and you don’t have to lose a lot of hard work
"As a YouTuber who primarily records and edits from her phone I was desperate to find an app that was better than Videoshop because it slowly went downhill over the years even though they charged more. All the functionality that Videoshop did away with, I found right here with CapCut!! The only recommendation I have is add a Subscribe and Instagram Logo sticker .. (My apologies if you have it I didn’t see one).."
"Look it’s great and all and I love how you can choose almost everything but small disclaimer: Why can’t you search up the sound you are trying to go for? And it’s hurting my brain cause I’m trying to go for a song that goes for this edit- And after all it’s great you can make your edits pop 👄 my sis and me were laughing at this Funniest thing I made, so it bring joy into my family! So thank you for reading this! Sry it was so short.."
Very good app I’ve used it my whole life this is the only editing app I could use because all the other apps are so confusing this is the best app I’ve ever tried I’m giving this a five star because it’s so good I love it and it’s amazing it’s so easy to use not hard it’s amazing I love using it every day to edit my videos it’s made me improve a lot through the years
"Capcut is a very good editing app and simple to use, but regarding the smooth slow motion it has a bug that’s really bothering me. When you apply smooth slomo on a cut video it will sometimes changes the video cut, for example if i recorded a 1 minute video and cut the first 20 seconds then applied smooth slomo it might change to the last 20 seconds of the video. This completely removes your progress and if you hit back it removes the slomo which takes a while to load."
"Ive used capcut for like a good 4 months but the new update with the velocity i cant find it like at all i dont know if its in my country but its not their i dont see that i have to update, i literally deleted capcut meaning all my videos are gone, so i suggest we put emails or log in so we can go back to our videos if we delete capcut, and also like i said i cant find it so i need a little help finding because its not on my device"
"I normally use CapCut for Gacha edits and I am confident of my tweeting abilities. The problem is, CapCut is to laggy and when I try to drag an arm or leg down, it goes up. Same thing in the opposite way. CapCut, please fix this. You would be the easiest app for Gacha tweening if you didn’t have so much lag. Every time I try to tween, I start to cry because of the difficulty. Please CapCut, fix this. Other than that, i would say CapCut isn’t that bad and would recommend to beginners. But like I said, don’t use this app for tweening."
"I love this app! It makes it so easy to edit things and post on tiktok and with it I’ve gotten more proud of my works! The thing is, I’m not gonna be able to continue if it’s gonna make me wipe out my whole storage…it always says I need to clear out stuff and when I clean out 50 things and it still says that, it’s kinda annoying wasting my time for nothing out of it. Someone help fix that cuz it’s getting annoying fast"
"When I first got CapCut I thought it it would be like every other video editing app, but this app is absolutely wonderful and I’m obsessed!! It’s so easy to use for beginners and I use it to make edits of my friends!! CapCut has so many premade templates and rlly allows u to create whatever!! You can export your own fonts and create your own colorings!! It is so helpful and overall I just love the app 💕💕"
"When I first got CapCut, i thought it would be hard to use. This would be surprising, being that usually when I download apps for editing, I usually have to watch tutorials. But, I figured it all out by myself! Also, they give you a ton of these cool effects, so it won’t be super hard to use. It is super easy and I promise you won’t regret downloading it!"
This editor app is really good not going to lie it’s really good for “starters” because you have practice on one video or in many videos called “projects”. It will be really cool if it was the same as alight motion because alight motion has more editing options than cap cut + alight motion has “in-app purchases” and cap cut doesn’t. Cap cut will be the best non purchases editing app. I like it too.
Capcut is amazing but… Sometimes it glitches and say you’re out of storage in the app and you need to clear some stuff out but like I’ve  deleted all the edits in there that I’ve done and that I’ve saved and it still says I’m out of storage but I think it’s a really good app like I’m a starter editor and I’m not that good at it and I make a bunch of Roblox edits lol but capcut that makes it easy to do it and I really recommend this app and I hope you download it 😃
"It used to be my go-to app whenever I wanted to edit something. It’s worked well for the 3 weeks I’ve been using it, but now I can’t use any transitions, effects, animations, etc. because the app tells me that I’m not connected to the internet, even though I am. I’ve tried disconnecting from the internet and reconnecting, and I’ve deleted the app and reinstalled it, but I still get the same pop up saying I’m not connected to the internet."
"This app has to be one of THE best editing apps I have ever downloaded. No watermark, no monthly paying subscription, no locked special effects. One thing I suggest is giving it the ability to name the sounds you extracted from videos. After I screen record a video, extract the sound and save it. So that way it makes it more easy to find it and more organized. Just a suggestion."
This app is so easy to use like neon it makes everything so easy for you just press a few buttons. You can also make you own like it’s so easy to the sound to making a zoom in and out it’s so easy I love this app so much it’s the app that I will use to edit and it shows the thing that you tubers use when they are like please stand by or something like that I’m in love ❤️
"I love CapCut, it is a great editing program that I suggest to Ppl who use Gacha Club or Life or even ppl who do edits. But I have some major issues with the program, every-time I open up the app and try to do some transitions or effects it always says no internet. Which is oddly weird bc I have internet, I would like to use CapCut because it’s probably the only App I know how to use. Please fix this issue."
"Hello. Everything is fine, but In this new version, I have a problem. The problem is that when you’re about to click, erase background, when you eliminate it, It eliminates it in a bad way, I liked more the way before this version. Could you let this new version, but leave the “Eliminate background” like it was before this NEW version. I’ll appreciate it, thank you. Good bye."
"Something went wrong when I tried to edit and it said “needs access for videos or photos” and I went to my settings and was confused what to do, I started deleting the app and went to the AppStore and when I typed in, “CapCut” I tried uploading in back up in my phone but it didn’t work so I tried again and it didn’t do anything. I don’t know what to do because I had tons of edits I made and I deleted it."
"I can’t even sugarcoat anything, idc how everyone else is doing, this app literally changed my life in the best way. It helps me mentally in alot of ways and the workflow
Is literally perfect. It crashes sometimes but bro at the cost of free, who cares. I’ve created so many videos for myself and for others and its so fulfilling to use. Thank you so much for this app, true app for creators and MORE. ANYONE can use this app."
"Hey! Thanks for making this app, it really helped me in editing videos and such!

I got some suggestions though, could you add an audio pitch feature? Since I wanna keep the video in normal speed but change its pitch, yeah I can only change the pitch by speeding it up.

And also could you add an audio quality feature too? I like making 2007-styled videos and I like lowering down the sound quality to make the vid more accurate, would be cool if you added it

And one last thing, could you add VHS quality and 1940’s-accurate quality voice effects? Yeah I’m that type of guy that likes making videos from different eras haha, but yeah it would be really nice if you could add the stuff I suggested.

But anyways, cool app!"
"Wow I tried using i movie or whatever to try and create something but this is like 100x better.. first of all it’s way simple to find out what to do and you can add cool ways of changing between videos pictures etc, and the most important part as when you save it, it doesn’t come out a super small square like I movie does. + there is no water mark."
"So my friend uses this, and I was still using KineMaster, so my friend told me to install this app instead. I was reluctant but did it, and it was TOTALLY worth it. Anyone using KineMaster who wants a step up from it should get this, it’s also easy and simple to use for beginners (like me ;-;) In conclusion, this is an awesome app, that is easy, simple, but also has a lot of opportunities to create things with it.

~A person 🌺🌸🌱🌼🏵"
This object way too much of my storage I’m not able to download any more apps without deleting half of my photos and some other apps I have I don’t like how this works and it takes up way too much I download this app for TikTok and like TickTock works when I edit it but this game is always like no you have to try again delete some story you don’t know how much storage is taking out like some of my favorite forwarders
"Ok, this editing app is pretty good! It was more than I ever expected, It’s super easy, and has a lot of cool features as well! I love editing videos now with this app, It’s easy, and there are a lot of possibilities to making edits/videos/etc. It never really crashes for me, and everything is basically free! it’s amazing, I recommend it for beginners, it’s easy, they’re so many cool affects, stickers, animations, etc!"
This is the best mobile editing app all my friends who edit use this and their edits look incredible you can do so many things it’s so awesome you can make smooth transitions and at first it’s not hard to figure out to do things and as you use it and use it and use it it gets so much easier this is the best editing app for mobile (in my opinion) I highly suggest you get this app!!
"I love making funny and random videos with this app but most of the time I can only make at least one and I have like hardly any games and like no videos so I don’t understand it says it says no storage why I’m not even gonna save it on my iPad so it’s just so dumb that it says no storage you can’t even create any of these like I want to create them without having no storage anyways I’m sorry I gave you a one star but I just had to because this is the most annoying thing I’ve ever dealt with in a app. 

But anyways it’s a great app other than that I like making funny videos with it keep up the good work!"
"Ive been using capcut for a while, but yestereday it stopped working for me. When i tried to click effects or animations, it said ""no internet connection, try again."" however, my internet was perfectly fine. I didnt know why it did this, so i just deleted the app and reinstalled it, yet it still didnt work. I also downloaded it on my another phone, and it worked there. is there anything i can do to fix this?"
I love that this app is free and it comes with so much stuff that are very helpful and convenient. I only have 2 minor problems. 1 the audio adjustment is not the best and could be better. 2 it has auto captions I think that is really cool but it is only in English and sometimes I don’t want to have to type out all the captions for my anime edits. Over all it is an amazing app and the best for your time.
"I just have one suggestion that would make things so much easier. Ok, so when ever adding a new clip or making a clip longer, all the effects ,which were lined up with other clips, get moved. Making it a tedious process to line them back up again. I think there should be some type of function that like pins the effect to the clip. It will make editing a lot easier in my opinion."
CapCut is an amazing app for editing and its totally free but i have one recommendation for the auto velocity. I think that for the auto velocity you should make it so you are able to pick where the velocity beat hits and make it so you can change how fast or how slow the beat is. Overall the app is amazing and i will continue to use it in the future! ❤️
"It’s very easy to use which is one of my needs. This app has a lot to offer! The editing is smooth, No annoying watermarks. Also, U can add your own music or sounds! This app is good but I have some suggestions, Maybe add more transitions and  filters. Also, Maybe add something where u can see what your layers look like. But overall this app is amazing!"
"HOLY BUCKETS! This is the best editing app ever! (Other then after effects,) but anyway, ITS AWSOME. it’s easy, simple for beginners, and the effects or *mwah* but……
After the new update, about a month ago, you added lots of stuff.
Like let’s say u kinda copied video star and after effects. Really? You copied video star, like let’s say the neon electric border. Looks similar right? Are u jealous of video star? It’s seems pretty much like that…."
"I love CapCut, not only that it is easy to use, but it’s free with tons of effects. Ive made 3 edits in ONE DAY and there the best yet, out of my basic kine master edits. But’ ShortCut isn’t the best. Before downloading hear this: this is not hate review. And, this is only about ShortCut. It’s a free feature so I know it won’t be too high on point. But, when I try effects adding, it goes to 20% and says “unavailable”. Otherwise I tell you to download this app!"
"CapCut is a good app for beginners the more u learn off of it in the more you get the hang of stuff there’s also people do tutorials how to use it if you don’t know a lot of stuff about it if we’re just learning how to use it and a lot of stuff is mostly really good I just feel like sometimes people fix some stuff what is it that it’s a really good app and get it Ethan do a lot of stuff with it and even overlay stuff like two overlays and all of that! 
Sincerely

Me-"
I’ve used capcut I think for four years but I have ALWAYS wondered why it doesn’t let me do certain things in style it always says “can not adjust current clip” and I’ve even tried to adjust the clip and still it did not work and your probably wondering what it’s for well it’s for the camera shake but still Great app!
What I like about this app is everything but as the title states I only have one request please add a feature that allows if you have audio that there could be a camera button that allows you to film like TikTok where it allows you to hear the audio when recording it would really help with A lot of my edits thank u and amazing app
"So I used this app for a month and it was great at first! Then I went to go do another video and it said I had to do something in setting and I went into settings and I couldn’t find what needed to be done, I tried deleting the app and it didn’t work it still wanted me to change something in settings and as I said, I couldn’t find it. Fyi, it didn’t tell my to do something in setting when I first downloaded it. Please fix this or tell my what I have to do in settings"
So I’ve been using this app since the beginning of 2021. I can edit and use many features on my edits in January to May. But I’m not sure how this happened but there are less features on the sound effects and there are less category’s. I would love to get the more sound effects features and the more categories on the sound effects. Idk why there are less effects however.
"I was working on my song and I didn’t know how to do the lyrics for the lyrics video and I was like let me go check out some app to help me ou. Then I came across this app and I got to say it was the best decision that I made for my lyrics vid, at first it was a little complicated, but when you get used to it gets pretty easy that’s why I’m giving this app a five star review and I highly recommend it."
I’ve only just started using editing apps and this was highly requested it’s very easy to use and understand lots of features completely free but if u had to add something it would be able to do more with the effects feature such as be able to move them around your photo or video and position them in a certain spot that would be a cool new feature.
"CapCut is amazing and probably better than most free editing apps that don’t put watermark, it works great but after a few exports it has been ruining the quality of the videos that I have worked hours on by making it pixelated or glitchy after the export, people have been saying it was good until after the 3.4.2 version and they say if you don’t want bad quality then just download it from google but that doesn’t work since I’m on iOS so there’s no way my edits will look good now, I really had hope for this app :/"
It’s really easy but I wish there could be more layers because on the app I used to use had a lot of layers but on the other hand it’s easier to use than other apps and I love that there is no watermark I can finally put my gacha/roblox/ text photo/layer/character/sentence in any spot with no struggle thank you so much for making this app and all the features but could use more!
I don't usually write these but this app is awesome and so much easier and better for editing. On top of that no watermarks! The transitions are amazing there is so much I could say!!! But... Your only allowed to have 6 layers I'm a gacha editor and it's hard trying to tween with only 6 layers and this is the only app I could find that has easy tweeing (kine master and cute cut are goodbut laggy and hard) anyways if you could fix this then I will make 5 stars!!!
"I loved being able to teach myself how to edit videos with this app since it was so easy for learning purposes. Now that I have the hang of it, it’s tons of fun. The only suggestion I have is to add a log-in and cloud future so we can use it across devices and keep old drafts (even if it was like a one-time payment or something). Would definitely invest a little to have that option!"
It’s an amazing app; so many options and things to do!! I do request if you could make it easier to overlay the animations. I would love if you added a feature like that because I personally would need it. I take up a lot of storage saving and putting more intro/outro animations. It would be really cool if you added more outro animation options too!
"One app that does it most and it’s free 
The most amazing thing you don’t have to worry and fuss about last minute repairs to your videos, right from your Smartphone in your hands CapCut gives you the best opportunity to look professional and creative with simple clicks just speed sometime and it’s surely will surely be wonderful and worthy and did I mention it’s free"
"I say the app is very good fore people including the new Auto Velocity update but i was working on editing for 1 hr and a half and i go get another overlay for a story and then im not on my project and i dont see it. It really took me long doing the overlays, captions/texts, text to speech, splitting, going through the video, etc. Im keeping what i was making personal but it was very hard and i managed yo make it 3 minutes and then bam. The project is gone 😢😭 Please fix i dont have motivation to make another"
"So the tutorial is not very helpful. My friends use this app as much as I use KineMaster, an AMAZING app to use along with this and PicsArt. I have no idea how to do ANYTHING on here except make “video covers”, which, mind you, don’t show up when I save them to my iPad. Adding music is VERY CONFUSING. VERY. Then again, I haven’t used to app in a while so I’m going to write another review tomorrow.
            Love,
            Luna 🏳️‍🌈👾💜🏐"
"I love this app. It really is very easy. The only thing that could get improved is the chroma key, but that will probably never be perfect, since this is a free app. I’ve had this for years and never once had I had to watch a tutorial to make a project. It is compatible with Tik Tok which made it way better. I totally recommend this for light, quick, and easy editing."
"I love this app, but i also have some ideas for Capcut. you should make an option for the “Speed” called “Smooth” where when you slow it down it isn’t so glitchy. Also, can you add something where we can make velocity edits? I would love if you added some of the effects that “Video Star Pro” has but for free! I hope you read this, thank you!"
I have used this to edit my animations for a year maybe more now and it’s really simple and great! The only down side is it may get slightly repetitive if you only use a set amount of effects so If you use this It would be good to experiment with all of them :) This app makes importing things like sound a breeze too so It’s definitely worth the download!
"I love the CapCut app but sometimes I forget exactly where I cut my video and I would like to be able to duplicate it when I need another copy for loops. Also at random times it tells me my storage is full I remove a lot of apps and pictures and it still says that it's full hopefully, something is not wrong with my phone. Other than that the app is great and I have no other problems with the CapCut app."
So I  got cap cut a while ago and I was new at the hole editing thing for TikTok I thought it would be so easy so I skipped The instructions how to use it and followed threw but if u don’t u may find it boring but read them and woah u fee like a pro for just a beginner u enter this world where you can edit move ur camera slow-MO and more! I can’t believe that cap cut took my rewind to a bad edit and mad it woah try CapCut it’s free!
"Okay, So far CapCut is the Best Editing App I’ve Come Across. But the One Thing That has Made me upset is that they Took Away Styles. And I Had Never Got to Use it before, And I Really wanted to Try it out. But When I found out that they Took It away I was Upset, so all I’m Asking is to Bring back Styles and the Velocity Style as Well. But overall the App Is the Best. And You Don’t have to Pay for it. So for all the Beginners I Recommend You Download CapCut.😁"
"Ok so I’ve been loving this up for more then a year. It’s been overall amazing, until they added this update, or if it’s even an update, I don’t know. So I’m making a video which to the text I usually just have to copy it change what it says then move it. 

  Today, when I tried to it moved to another spot. I thought it just wasn’t working well so I restarted and even went to another project and tried it. It still didn’t work. This is a huge bug to me because I have to keep adjusting it which takes way more time to put it in the exact same spot for each text."
Personally I have been looking for an app to use for my editing videos but I haven’t found one this good it’s an amazing app to use and to edit with I really enjoy this app there is a few changes that could be done just small changes but it’s still an amazing app to use I really enjoy using it and it’s way easier to use than any other app I tried
"This app has all you need for editing and is absolutely free, it hasn't crashed on me once and it has audio editing too! Id recommend it even for beginner editors because its so easy to use! There's plenty of transitions, animations, and effects for audio! You can adjust clips and even edit the amount of contrast, shadows, hue, ect. I love this app and use it for all of my editing needs"
I downloaded this app cause I saw someone’s edit on instagram and it was really good and they said that they used this app so I decided to try it out and to my surprise I can use all of the features on this app for free! I used to play for premium on another app but after seeing all that this app has to offer I have realized I am much better off using this app from now on!
"Ok, overall the entire app is just,🔥. But I think it was the recent update that made me a bit sad about it. One of them i noticed had a maximum overlay restriction, and i needed more than 6 overlays to make my edit. It bugged me a bit and i’d like if you’d maybe put it back the way it was before? Thank you if you saw this and put it into consideration."
"The App is great! I think it includes everything necessary to make the perfect edits! Only one thing.. THEY REMOVED THE STYLE BUTTON!! I really enjoyed that button because it gave me the the option to do the 3d effect and AUTO VELOCITY!! Of course there were other quirks too but those were my favorite! Please Please Pleaseeee add it back!! Other than that, I highly recommend CapCut!!"
"I love this app, so much! It is an amazing editing app, yet I have some suggestions. Today I accidentally deleted something that I didn’t export. I am here to request a ‘ Deleted ‘ spot where you can find all your deleted works. Here you can recover and delete forever. I would also like to request an unlimited amount of overlays. Thank you!"
"It doesnt really matter how many features you have. It doesn't really matter that it’s absolutely, no catches free!! What matters is if the average person with NO video or photo editing experience can actually pick it up and use it.  There are absolutely NO instructions. There is not a single walkthrough. 

“HEY!! Here is a free app for you! Hope you enjoy it! OH! By the way! Have fun figuring out how to use it on your own!”

The developers released this app completely under the assumption that you already know how to edit photo and video! It is an insult to guys like myself that know little to nothing about  this stuff."
"I love the app, easy to use, easy to edit, and easy to post from one platform to another. But the thing is just sense there’s a new update about now having your favorited TikTok sounds to be connected to CapCut, it’s not really working for me ☹️. Even if I have wifi or not it’ll still not work and publish my favorited sounds on it. If you can try to fix it then okay, if you can’t then it’s okay."
I really love cap cut I am a beginning editor and it is so easy to use I absolutely love it my problem is u can’t move footage to another part for instance if u are doing an overlay and u want to move the footage u can’t it does not have that feature and it does need quite a few more sound effects before u listen to anything bad about Cap Cut just try it plus it’s free😊
"Hello, I’m going to start off saying I love CapCut. But, there’s a small issue with it. I usually make Starstable related videos and wanted some hoof sound effects for a cantering horse. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find any. All there was, was a whinny and a horse pulling a cart, which sounds like a trot. If you could add some more horse sound effects, it would be VERY helpful! Thank you for reading, goodbye!"
"I’ve been using CapCut for 2 months and I’ve decided to tell this issue. I make gacha videos, so I put a lot of screenshots in, but whenever I make the video screenshot smaller,it kicks me out or would be really laggy. I know you have a lot of work to do but when your done, please try to read this and try to do something about the lagging. (Hope you have a great day! :D)"
So all works good EXCEPT for overlay and sticker. My screen is not glitching I turned my phone off 3 times and re-download CapCut 5 times. I tried pressing the sticker or overlay option but NONE work. It would be amazing if you update this. All good just some options doesn’t work. I have been experiencing this for 2 days and it’s still not working. I like making edits for kpop and now my FAVOURITE app is now not working. Thank you
"Thais app is amazing and I love it and I make videos where I have to take screenshots and sometimes the screenshots don’t line up and then it looks weird and so I tested something and it didn’t work so, if you cropped a photo and you copied it then replaced it with a different photo could it also be cropped the same way as the other photos 
Thanks , this would really help"
"It’s great for a free app. The best part is no ads, no money to spend on it. I don’t use the text presets but they are beyond cool. Perfect for making edits, and your own videos. My only problem is that when I try to put an overlay of a png it makes the background black. I tried to add a video with a transparent background but it didn’t work. Saddest part was it was a png i animated for an hour"
"I love this app so much. I can’t believe everything is completely FREE! Such as animation, effects, transition and more!🤯 We don’t have to pay for VIP or Membership , unlike others editing app😐.I recommend you to download it because it’s really easy to use ,especially if you’re new to editing. 
Whoever created this app they’re genius 😏
And Thank You for reading this. ❤️"
Almost every time I want to make a video on there it’s always saying I have full storage and it’s not my device it’s the app! Because I keep deleting photos from my photos gallery over and over again and it tells me the same thing! It’s just so annoying to the point we’re I hate the app like that much.
I love the app but I have some suggestions can you blur out cuss words in songs because I don’t wanna hear them and can you make a thing to edit songs like make is slow or fast if your already add that can you show me because if any of you know how to show me please oh and can you add a thing for moving stuff and suggesting them.
"I usually don’t leave reviews on apps, but I just feel like this app needed some recognition. It is super easy to use, and makes it look so smooth when you are done editing your videos. I have many countless edits on this app and all have turned out absolutely magnificent. It works if you are a beginner or a professional and ITS FREE. I completely recommend this app 10/10."
"So i made something that took 2 hours to make and it doesn't save, i thought it had something to do with my storage but i deleted all my photos and videos and it still didnt save. And I also deleted my project except the one i was working on. And then to make sure it wasnt my storage so i made a new project put a random picture and it still didn't save!"
"So this app is AMAZING don't get me wrong. I've been having this app for abt 2-3 months now and all of a sudden it doesn't work. It doesn't let me do anything except add audio and multiple videos and photos. Doesn't let me do overlays, stickers, text, and the other things you can do. It's really devastating and I honestly really need it to edit. I've tried deleting it and reinstalling it, closing it and opening it, and even power off my phone. Idk if it's my phone or it's capcut. But please fix whatever's going on. Please and thank u<3

-Sugey ❤️"
"I’ve been using capcut for a while now, and this never happened to me. But every time I import a sounds it doesn’t import. I’ve got out and got back in and stuff but it just says “add audio” even if I already did. I deleted it and made a new one still didn’t work. It’s being really annoying now. It’s been happening too long. Fix this, it may happen to others."
"I love CapCut!! It’s easy to make edits and everything makes sense, but whenever I try to use a green screen, it leaves little green spots around it, which is a little frustrating. I thing there should be a few more effect ideas. Also, when I try to make a slow edit, the quality is not great, so I think you guys should probably fix that. But other than these few things, I love this app!"
"Okay i use CapCut for RBLX edits or something but like I want better motion. Like when u press the diamond thing and move it like slowly, it goes like fast. I would like CapCut to fix that. I also have som suggestions. Like when u have a overlay, there could be a button that says “glow” and adjust it so how much it would glow. And u could also select the color of the glow. Thanks!"
"By far the best video editing app out there. I have used so many video editing apps, but this one is top notch in every way. I own a videography business and this is what I use when I’m traveling and want to make professional level videos on the go. Very easy to use and downloads so much faster than other editing apps. Highly recommend."
"Im a teen without a job to get money, and it you think my parents will pay for a monthly subscription to a video editor then think again. As a small youtuber, this app has genuinely helped me edit videos without worry of a subscription. Thank you capcut! Keep telling us to keep our money in our pockets!"
"This app is pretty good for making simple video edits, up to professional video edits once you fully learn how to use it, but i was wondering if you could add a fit to cropped video feature, where the backround would be sized the same as the video that was edited and cropped. Overall great app though, I would recommend!"
It’s so much easier to edit with and it has so many cool features. In some editing apps it doesn’t even give you music. Well no more. CapCut gives you so many songs to choose from which are really good. I used to use another editing app and there was no music options. It wasn’t that good either. You should give CapCut a five star rating
"When I opened CapCut there was no edits so then I feedback CapCut. I went into CapCut again and it was fixed but when I clicked the + button it’s said I needed to do this. So I pressed confirm. As normal it takes me to settings then after that I clicked CapCut but I didn’t see where you save videos. So, I deleted CapCut and reinstalled after I clicked the + button but still it says I have to save my videos. I regret delete CapCut. :("
"This app is amazing and all but the problem is that every time I want to make a video it keeps telling me to clean my storage and it really annoys me to the fact that I have to delete my hard work just because of my storage and I tried to delete some of the hand videos I didn’t want In my photos app but it still shows that, and I really want you to fix it"
"I love this app with all my heart but I have come across a problem. When I make an edit, on the app it looks amazing, but when I export it to my camera roll. The transitions (animations) are super choppy and some of them don’t even look like the original transitions I put on. It is a super great app and it looks amazing within the app but in your camera roll it looks bad :( hopefully you could get that fixed it would be great! :)"
I don't use use the app to make edits but i use it to make slowmos! They always come out super smooth when you put the resolution on 2/4k and the frame rate to 60! I recommend this app if someone is looking to make really smooth slowmos without needing video star pro or after effects. I with they added a twixtor effect so it was even better but overall an amazing app!
"This is an awesome app! I do things with it all the time, such as animating and things like that! This app is also pretty easy to use and I highly recommend it! By the way, there’s this problem where the audio, but I’m using the microphone on the app, the audio comes really low volume, I’m not sure if it’s because it’s my iPad or it’s the app, so yeah, I have nothing more to say, have a nice day!"
"The app is amazing!, I use it to edit all my roblox TikTok videos. I stopped editing for about a month and I come back to the app to edit a new video but for some reason it wont let me press any buttons at the bottom if that makes any sense. For example the Format button it wont let me press it. I’ve already reset the app and just incase I even deleted the app and re downloaded it. I’m not sure whats going on but yea."
"I love this app so much! It makes editing a lot easier and I love the multitude of editing options I can choose from, except the videos I can make are limited by length. The longer the video gets the more laggy it gets and which makes it harder to edit. All the tools are amazing but I feel the length of which the video that can be made using the app needs improvement."
"Bruh CapCut is literally to the death of me, first no ads!!!! Second, everything is like free and the transitions omg 💀💀💀 I love them so much. (the animation ones haha)  CapCut is feeding us well with these amazing animations. I use this app with cute cut pro, and it just works so well. There’s also no watermark which is a big thing. I am so glad I came across this app. I will be using this app for edits later on 🧍‍♀️"
Did capcut update its slow motion thing? I seen a tik tok that said capcut updated it’s slow motion to be smoother? Also if it did how come mine hasn’t updated yet. I always have to delete capcut and other apps because of my storage and I reinstall it when making videos. So if it did update could u tell me why mine hasn’t updated yet? 😟 I’m on a iPhone 6s Plus 💀
"When I add an overlay and have the green screen be removed when I press the remove background button it either takes out the entire thing or only bits so I don’t know if you can do this but can you choose where people want the background to be removed like choose what part they want removed, other than all that this is one of the best editing apps I have ever had in my life"
"I’m so so pleased with this app it has so many diverse free effects that you can use for any type of video you’re editing whether it be for a fan account, for school, etc. There’s no video limit like with other editing apps. It’s a little difficult to get the hang of at first but once you do it’s amazing! 10/10 highly recommend :)"
I am in love with everything about this app. It makes content creation for Instagram reels and TikTok so much easier and with more than just the basic editing tools one needs but super super easy to understand and use. It definitely makes a difference and I always use it for editing my videos. Thank you guys so much for such an amazing app.
"I love this app, it’s grate for beginners and maybe even for pro editors, I love the graphics! And the effects are nice! But it always says my storage is full and that I can’t download the app, I press the download button like usual when you wanna download a app again after you deleted it,
But when I press it it will not download, this has never happened before, and my storage is not full, I can not update my phone (idk why) but please fix this"
"This app was actually really helpful! I joined a 30k follower esports team as an editor! I did it, working on montages everyday. Then one day, it stopped working. So my first thing I tried doing was deleting it and then downloading it back. I did that,and then the same thing happened! I checked for updates, no updates. Now I can’t use any effects,texts,or speed or anything else. Please respond"
I love this app and it is great to use but I just spent the last 4 1/2 hours editing this video and it turned out great. I left the app and I went back in to show one of my friends and it won’t let me play it at all. I tried everything I restarted the app and my phone but no luck and it feels as if it is just gone because when I press on it it takes me to as if I am about to edit and it is a blank screen and I can’t even hit the back button. I’m so upset Because I worked so hard on that video. So I suggest not putting to much effort in to it apparently.
"I used to hate editing videos for my video production and editing class. I was using kapwing and wevideo and it was so difficult to edit stuff, and it was glitchy and things weren’t adding my clips in right, until I met cap cut and this app is easy,I get it very,it has no lag, and you can make some really cool videos, so thank you Cap cut,because now I love editing videos and it’s not a nightmare."
"I have just one thing, I think you should be able to add like animations and transitions because sometimes I will be using an animation that’s at the very back and I don’t wanna apply to all but also don’t wanna have to scroll to the very very back ya know? But otherwise this app is amazing I love it it is very similar to vita but this is definitely better for edits"
"Ok so I’m a gacha tuber and I use this on all my memes. I love the effects and transitions. It makes my videos much better quality.

The only bad thing is that sometimes it won’t let me add images but I just have to delete the tab and re open the app and it’ll be normal again. It’s only a small glitch with an easy solution so I don’t mind it. 

So yeah I recommend the app and I love it."
"This app is the BEST editing, it has every sticker you’d want, any transition, anything!! It can be hard at first because you don’t know what to do or how to do it, but once you get to know it’s literally awesome! And.. it has no watermark! Every app I had was horrible because I couldn’t afford their price, and it’s free which makes it awesome, so you can be happy and don’t waste money!!"
"Ok, so when I downloaded this app it was amazing! Until I experienced a laggy, robotic sounding voiceover. I am trying to make a story, but it won’t sound right. So, I hope you get this message and fix this one little bug! Thank you for listening!"
"So, I overall like the app and it’s the easiest to use out of all the ones I’ve used. Although, there are some things that should be improved. 1# video quality: when I put a video in, it looks choppy when I’m editing (and after) but when I look at the video before it was edited, it’s super clear. I’m not sure what happened but this is an ongoing problem for me. Please fix this!"
"Hello, this is the reason why I give 3 stars. I love the app I use it for my videos but the songs has cuss words and some of the thumbnails shows inappropriate content. I can’t choose the music, and the problem that it lags when I go in the app for 1 or 2 hours. May you please fix that? And can you put music that’s friendly and for kids, and the thumbnail is appropriate. Otherwise I still recommend this app."
"I’m no professional by any means, but for an app that gives you full editing power and can export quality videos, its outstanding. 

Then there’s the fact that it doesn’t gouge you for money at any point during the process. I love companies that make incredible stiff like this, I’m just glad I found this one. Hope everyone else loves it too"
"If your on mobile or PC, I totally recommend this app. I use it to make roblox edits and it’s so EASY to use! They have really good transitions, good effects, and if you like to make anime edits I recommend this app also. I don’t think I have any recommendations for it though. But yeah if your thinking of getting the app I totally recommend it, I’m still new to editing so this app really helps me!
PEACE
✨💖😍🥰✨"
CapCut is a really simple and not at all difficult app it is so easy if you find this hard then you need are literally beneath the age of five this is literally so easy to do and if your clips are all messed up CapCut a literally let you put them in order add music or put filters I love this up and no other app could literally beat this or video tutorial
I think the creators of cap cut should add a feature that makes it easyier to edit how long stuff stays on screen like there should be a way  to edit them all like you want them all at 0.5 seconds there should be a way to do that all at once so you have to do them all by them self witch takes forever and this would greatly improve the app in my option
"You see, CapCut is an amazing editing app. I don’t know whether or not it’s on my part but the editing screen is too small. Some of the animations are malfunctioning. I delete texts and when I rewrite things, there still there, even though theres no indication of it ever being there. It just has some tweaks and stuff. Not too big of a deal, but since I use it pretty often, it’s has gotten quite hard to use. That is all for now."
"I love this app so many transitions, options for effects and more! Just one minor issue is when I insert a sticker it doesn’t want to do the animation I gave it. For example I wanted it to fade it but when I exited the editor it never faded it it just popped up like I had done no animation on it. Please fix this bug because I am getting a little bit frustrated!"
"Hello capcut! This app has improved so much and I have used it for pretty long now, but one thing really bothers me, when I try to click edit and then speed (for the audio) it is blacked out and I can’t use it, and I need to use it for a bunch of my edits, so if you could please stop that “darkening out” so I can actually use it. Thank you so much! It would help a lot and is a must have for me. (Yes, I have already tried searching it up but no results.) thank you."
"I love the app but it has one flaw that i just got yesterday and it still is happening. So basically when i use like the sunset effect number 1 it makes weird black flashes after it’s exported. I hope it gets fixed because I really need to have good looking vids for edits. 
Don’t Rush on the Bug but just do your best ^^ 

Sincerely,
anonymous user"
"i’m not even gonna lie i love this app so much. ever since i’ve started using it i’ve oddly been more productive and my edits have came out better. i haven’t even been using the transitions either (which are amazing and not the ones you see in every other app). there’s so many features that are fun to play around with and i find myself doing something different every time! 

two suggestions, i would love if we could import our own fonts!!! i love the ones that are there but i would like more variety. also, i wish we could adjust the opacity/intensity of the effects!! 

the fact that this app is free though? thank you so much!!! i love it"
"How come we can’t search the song that we’re looking for? Are you picking out other songs so we don’t play something inappropriate? We’ve all heard some disturbing things before. I would give this 5 stars but this is just annoying, why do we have to pick songs that are already picked for us when we can search them up ourselves?"
"Found it from a video on Tik Tok, just the app I’ve been looking for.  I think it should have a mode where you can move the edited faces (Like Dark Side sticker) around so you can have it attached to one person at a time, and have it where the face isn’t always crooked, other than that the app’s perfect"
"heyo! me again. I love capcut so much. whenever you do a update again this is just a suggestion. maybe on the in and out animations you could add a way so people could add the animation to all clips/texts. I personally love to make text overlays with songs, and I know other people do as well and this would make it go by easier + faster! :)"
"I just got this app and I’m already in love with it! I love all the stickers and awesome effects! But one little problem… When I checked my iCloud storage, I have so much storage/space! But when I go into CapCut, it says I don’t have any space to make a video! I only made one short video and it won’t let me make a second one. Can you please maybe fix that if you have time or can? I’m sorry if It sounds rude."
"I really love using this app for my tiktoks, but i think you should add a favorite section to the animations so you dont have to keep going back and forth. Something else i think you should do is making a video about all the tips and tricks about the app like how do i make a overlay ect ect, yet again this is a suggestion so you dont have to do it but you can if you want! Thank you if you read this."
Capcut is an AMAZING editing app. I definitely suggest it! I have one suggestion which is maybe have something to check if the music is copyrighted or not Please and Thank you! I also want to say Capcut takes a lot of storage up and battery so please move some things around and that’s pretty much it! I hope the Developers read this it would be a pleasure! 4/5 ✨👏🏽
"I love this app, I make anime edits on it’s because I’m a nerd. It has amazing features and one of the best mobile editing apps, but there’s just one thing. Keyframes. Keyframes would really helps so you can make text from right up to the screen to in the middle, the way you want it. And yes I know there’s a filter but I would still really help. Overall I love it."
"I love this app, its free, has no watermark, ready to use sounds, but its very slow. It takes at least 20 seconds to open a wip.
I press the video and 20 seconds later it opens. It may just be my phone, but i doubt it. My phone has never lagged, and still hasnt to this day, so im guessing its the app. But who knows? Not me, obviously. Other than that, i love the app, and i just think thats the only problem i have with it."
"okay, so I’ve been using this app for a few months now. I absolutely love it and my yt videos are better because of this app
 But.. there’s been a problem lately to where I can’t use overlays or any effects.. I’ve tried rebooting my iPad and going back, then deleting the app. Once I got the app back I still had the same problem 
Same with sound effects

Overall amazing app"
"It’s pretty great and all, but it stopped working after a while. I can’t overlay or put text anymore and I tried on multiple projects. I’m not sure if it’s the layers it something, but it just wouldn’t work. I have spent hours trying to get it to work reinstalling it multiple times. It just won’t work. I can’t put filters anymore either. Basically if I touch the overlay button my phone crashes. FIX THIS NOW"
"Hello cap-cut creators! Capcut is a great app and very fun to edit with! But i keep on getting bugs! And capcut keeps crashing and it won’t let me play the video i made. Can you please fix this? I don’t know if it’s my internet or capcut, but I’m pretty sure it’s capcut. If you could fix it that would be great. Thanks! Otherwise capcut is a great editing app and I’ve made hundreds of edits with this app. Definitely would recommend to download it."
"So capcut is one of the best editing app and it is easy to use just one problem everytime I try to add animation and press the effects i want there will be a pop up saying "" connect to the wifi or check ur connection"" but the thing is i am connected to the wifi and im the only one who uses it its been two days since this has happened...."
"It was a very good app until it started bugging out. Now whenever I try to use transitions, it says I have internet connection issues. I’ve tried everything to fix it, but nothing worked. I checked my connection, updated the app, deleted and reinstalled it, but I’m still getting that error. The app is also really laggy, and that makes tweening and animating nearly impossible. It definitely needs work."
"The first month i had it, it worked great. Then i had to make an edit a bit longer than what I normally do. I filled up my storage too much so I cleared it out. Then I couldn’t even view my edits, so i left it alone for about an hour. Why have all my edits been deleted?!?! I deleted them from my camera to “clear up storage” even though my phone was using even less storage than usual. Now i have no way of accessing my edits. I had a total of five, deleted. What. Happened

Edit: i got my edits back but it still says im using too much storage. I am using less than usual!"
"I personally love CapCut, it’s really easy to use so I like it above any other editing apps I’ve tried. But, at one point I needed to delete the app since I was running low on storage, but now I can’t download it anymore. I have enough storage and it shows up when I search it, but whenever I hit the download button, nothing happens. Does anyone know how to fix this issue?"
"Audio needs more attention adding audio from files would make this 11/10 just thats the one things this app is missing in my opinion 😕 still a great and easy to use app for editing tho, have made things on cap cut that would I feel like have taken months as a professional editor 😎"
"If I’m being completely honest this is the best editing/video app in opinion, you can add your own sound,there’s stickers,backgrounds,and much more but the only problem is that when I try to export my video it says “not enough storage free up some storage to continue “ even when I have enough storage for about 20 videos, but overall this is a great app!"
Ok so I found this looking for a video editor in the App Store and it didn’t look cool but I also wanted a video editing app where you remove the background without a green screen so when I realized you could do that I got it then I saw how it had multiple effects and filters and now I love it! If I could I would give this app an infinity star rating!
"It is an excellent application, easy to use, but it has made me uninstall applications and other files, emptying the phone's RAM memory and I always received a message saying that I did not have space to edit a video.  Also, when I want to apply sound effects, the app sends me a message that I have no internet signal ... But as if I have internet at home, I also have unlimited internet on my phone.  Simply put, uninstall the app because it doesn't work right.  So here I leave my testimony and judge for yourself ..."
"Ok so, I love and enjoy CapCut very very much I really think video star is confusing. And this is way easier . But when you guys made the new “update” when I try to click on my usual effects (and this problem is only on the effects) it says “no internet connection please try again later” and it only happens to the ones that I need."
"I’ve been using CapCut for awhile now, but recently it hasn’t been letting me change the opacity in the text boxes. I would love for that to be fixed, but everything else it perfect! It’s free, easy to use, and won’t put a CapCut watermark (unless they made the edit) on your video! I love making edits with this app! Definitely my favorite, but I still would love for people to fix the text box’s opacity issue :)"
Hey! You app has everything I need to edit anything but the only problem I have with the app is the fact that I can’t keyframe my text so I can animate it to move across the screen to my liking. If you guys could add that feature that would be amazing and that would literally make this app the #1 editing app on every mobile platform🔥🤘
"i really love capcut and it has all the transitions needed its like having Videostar but having it on all platform!!, you have all the special transactions and, effects i love them they are so nice to use, 😁😁 i love that it doesn’t take much time to upload your video, so many awesome types of things you can do on that app thank you so much Capcut for editing my videos!! 💋"
"First of all, its free. I’ve been wanting to edit things so beautifully but i cant afford paying anything for apps and all that. I downloaded it today and omg! I learned almost everything abt it, it has all featured paid apps like video star has, and its so simple! I want to congratulate everyone who made this app! It honestly saved my quarentine lol. Keep up with all that good work! 💕"
This app is completely free and doesn’t make you put a watermark on your videos unless you choose to. It has so many cool tools and everything I want in a editing app. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Also they may not have all the songs you want but you can fix that if you have IOS and screen recording a sound and imputing it to your edit.
"I live in the USA and try to create some videos by using the free template from my home country. Since I updated a new version, i cannot use it anymore even though I had tried to use vpn to switch my network to another country. I love capcut because it helps me to make a lots of interesting videos, but now I cannot create more video due to that reason. Hopefully Capcut can reconsider and let more customers from another country use it."
Hi I been on CapCut for a long time when I just got this I was so happy to be able to edit better but when I got on I was sad cuz I could only put 16 or less pics so it can go in my photos the thing and some edits are too short so I’m asking to make the edits longer and let ur users add more photos
"So for my first 2 edits I was able to extract sounds from my favorites list on TikTok however on my 3rd one where I usually find my favorites it say to connect there is no internet however I have the wifi connected cause everything else is working fines I don’t see the problem I’ve also tried opening and closing the app multiple times, this is the only reason I give it 3 stars, otherwise it’s an amazing app and I love to use it."
"i love it, everything is amazing about it. but my iphone 6s cannot handle everything i do on there. i have had to delete so many projects of either my phone being slow or capcut just messing up. me personally, i think capcut is an edit app where everyone can make sick edits! it just doesn’t have all the things that videostar pro has or something. but everything is like free on there. also sometimes i put like tiktok videos in capcut so if i ever run out of wifi or like my sim goes out or something (i can’t remember the name.) i’ll be able to watch some tiktoks on there. honestly i recommend it. 

hope this helps!!!"
I mean it is really easy to use for one. And it has a lot of great features too. In my oppinion it is a really good beginer app for editing. The only two things i complain about are the effects and velovity. The effects aren’t that bad but they could get improvenent. And for velocity is that it is really hard to do because if you like try to do it how it’s suppoesed to be it looks wierd but anthing else it pretty good! 100% recomend it!
"i love this app, it’s so easy to use! however, whenever i use the keyframe feature, it always zooms in on the video when i don’t want it to. i want the keyframes to go side to side, and it’s just not working. also, i think you should add more text features to make it more updated and easy to use. but overall, it’s an AMAZING app and i definitely recommend downloading it."
"I freaking love this app 9/10 the only thing i would change is that when selecting things to edit you swipe over them to add them not tap that little bubble in the corner it takes forever to add it takes me a good 6 minutes adding a 100 screenshot video, mostly because I click exit on accident or I keep missing the bubble. Other than that I love the app!"
I used this app for awhile now it worked good you know no problems until today. I ran out of storage on CapCut so I deleted it all and then it told me “CapCut Requires access to the album for editing and saving videos” so I clicked next and it took me to settings and there was no option to let me give it access so I reinstalled the app hoping it would work and no same problem I think this is just a glitch but please fix this or help me.
"Basically, I have been using CapCut for a while and it is going well. Except I had used so much storage and CapCut told me that I don’t have enough memory. I deleted so many memories and still, No storage space. I deleted so many videos and pictures and still no storage!! I also deleted many apps too. So many memories, Wasted!"
"Okay so, I've had this app for 4 months now. ITS WONDERFUL!.. But.. I had to delete and re-download the app, because it was lagging really bad, and I forgot how to let it access my photos 😒🙄. I just have a suggestion of when you first download the app, it can access the photos with just an “allow” or “don’t allow” button. I know this may sound dumb, but, PLEASE! 
Thank you for making such a wonderful app, 

-Phoebe"
"Overall this app is really impressive when it comes to video making and editing. It is super useful, and it gives you all types of options! It is so fun to use. You can get super creative with this, although I don’t recommend it for animation. But other than that it is really good to use! ❤️"
"i download this app just added some thing for the end of the year, it has improved my editing so much on this app I totally recommend it. I also love that you can take away the watermarks not like any other editing app which I love so much I can edit anything like pictures of family which I completely like."
"Making slow motion a little more smoother. When changing the speed to make videos slower, it literally goes frame by frame to slow it down which is quite annoying to me sometimes but I think it would be better to make it smoother. If that’s not in your league then its completely fine."
"No matter what, it won’t let me do basic transitions, effects, etc. because I “don’t have internet connection” and I DO! Sorry if I’m being rude but, I HAVE 3 BARS OF WIFI AND UNLIMITED DATA!!!! Again, sorry if this came off as rude, it wasn’t meant to be, but I hope I’ll hear back soon so I can continue editing! 

Sincerely, you customer, Karah Dorothy Hamling"
"It’s prob one of the best editing apps I’ve used on my phone, mostly because there isn’t a watermark!! But I would suggest some things to make it a bit better. I really wish there was graphs with the keyframes. I also kinda wish the slow motion wasn’t so glitchy (or it might just be my phone who knows). I don’t really know what else to say but over all I rlly like this app!!"
"I love this app! It’s totally FREE, there’s transitions, and you could add music!! You could also do affect sounds! It even has a very easy tutorial on how to use it! you could edit pictures and videos!! I use this app all the time to express myself! I never thought there was a app as good as this app!! I love This app and I think it should have a 5 star rating."
"I’ve mixed videos together for literally decades. I can’t believe how easy this is to use to create fun videos. Get this app. Now. Why are you still reading? 

I wish it was easier to add my music. I have some music in folders other than iTunes and it’s virtually impossible to add. I’ve figured a workaround, but this would be a nice enhancement. 

Great job!"
It’s good I use it all the time but now I can’t because my storage was full for it and I deleted photos and apps and it still doesn’t work and I have little bit of apps left and I don’t wanna delete it. Number 2 can you guys add more layers so we can do more please it would help a lot.
"Hello! I love this app so much! It’s super helpful, but my only worry is if it looks on your photos. I cant let it look in my photos because i wear a hijab and when you click “select photos” when you first install the app it doesn’t let you add any other photos after the ones you just picked. I need this immediately answered!!"
I’m an Instagram editor and the thing I want is being able to change brightness on keyframes so it looks like the video star flash Like I really want that so if you could plz add that ability to the app it would be literally perfect and you cannot chroma key after doing it for like 3 times so if you could fix that I’d be thankful ❤️
"This game is fine I can make all my videos on it and it’s smooth, high quality, and has great options. I just don’t get those one star views and when I read them it’s all about bugs 🤷‍♀️ it’s not really the apps you just probably got a virus cause it works smoothly. So it works great nice editing just don’t get the one ⭐️"
"Do you know how you can write sentences and put them on your video? I tried that! But there’s sort of one problem that keeps irritating me and it is a nuisance. No offense but it is true, and what I see here is becoming a problem as it already is. It doesn’t show up on my screen when I make the video. I tried fixing it and it does but when I do it the second time it doesn’t show up. If you don’t know where this is going I can prove it to you on social media."
"Hello Capcut! I am informing you about the problem with no style button. Its odd because I just had this option like just last week and now it isn’t there?😂 I believe its just a lag in capcut but I would like to see it soon as possible. Please help. Overall your app is a great platform for editors and its very fun to create edits on your platform. But please, do fix the style option problem. Its creates stress for people who want to make edits (including me)❤️"
"I love this app so much and I make all of my edits on here, but one thing that makes my edits so much better, is the styles option. A lot of my edits on CapCut are Velocity and I’m not good at manually doing velocity so I normally use auto velocity, but when I got my clips ready, I got confused when I couldn’t find the styles option? I just think many people on CapCut will agree and I would like to think I speak for every user of this app. Especially on tiktok too"
"I really love CapCut. The app is really easy to navigate & you get use to using to the different tools pretty fast. My only thing that I wish could be different is the censor sticker. Could you make it smaller so that it wouldn’t take up so much space on the screen. If you were to change this, I could give CapCut a 5/5 stars, because other than this the app is really good."
"Love this app, it has all the features you could dream of and doesn’t shove adds or subscriptions in your face.

There is one bug i come across frequently though, it says “No internet connection” when I try to load my saved tiktok sounds. It requires me ti delete and reinstall to get the feature working. Other than that the app is perfect."
"As the title said, I love the app love everything about except that it takes up all my storage. The other thing is, it is so hard to animate things. I had to delete the app a few times because it took up to much space. My iPad doesn’t have a lot of storage so yeah. I also feel like it would be more popular if it didn’t take up a lot of storage.

Thank you for reading this"
"I rated this five stars so you would read this.
Its really a 3 star because when I open this app it keeps saying its not connected to the internet but I am. So a lot of my features are gone. Over all, before this glitch I really loved it so thats what made me rate 3 stars. I uninstalled this app and I am going to try again. 

This was a lovely app."
It is a amazing editor where even the beginners can learn to use it. It has a lot of different editing options and I mean a lot but it misses same factors we would like in editor like manual background removing. Overall a amazing editor and I recommend it to anyone that has started editing or has been editing for a while!
I personally love this app it always did what I always needed it to do advanced or simple the only problem I ever had with this app is that there’s no motion blur I love the new adding of the graphs but they shouldn’t add motion blur for them graphs would look more clean and professional but other than that 10 stars in my book!!!
"I love CapCut so much but there is sometimes glitches. If I put text on my edit, after playing around with it for a little while the text will start having a mind of its own. Some text will appear before other words when I haven’t even placed it to be like that. When I try to fix it, it doesn’t work and I have to start over. This is why I give CapCut 4 out of 5 stars."
I love this app so so much it’s a big step ahead from IMovie. But I really don’t like that when I try to use shortcut it often glitches and never ever loads when I want to make a short. But other hen that I love it there are so many features and stickers and I love that I can color correct my videos. Next best thing to Adobe.
This app is amazing I love capcut I make gacha vids and it’s preety good I love that it’s free no adds the effect are just the best and I’m actually glad it’s not that hard to use because I have experienced other apps that make you wnat to pay and it’s kinda hard for me to use thanks to cap cute I can post more vids and everything works smoothly for me!
"So, the app is great totally recommend to use this app to edit but one problem I know you need to update the app after a few months but when it tells me to I press it to make a update and it doesn’t work that well and it doesn’t update anything but after all totally recommend it works great"
"As a small gachatuber, I loved this app. Up until the new update.
The update added more facial features, which is pretty cool, but in gacha club, when I take screenshots, I have to squeeze them into seeing no black. CapCut was good for putting the screenshots in there and animating them. Then, today I was planning to make a video, and in CapCut, there was a black vortex on the edges in my opinion, this reduces the quality of the video. Please fix this.

P.S. yes, I did shrink the screenshots in."
"This app is really good for beginner editing! Honestly it’s a lovely app but, it takes up so much storage! Also, when I go to clear the stuff to get more storage I go back to the editor and it says insignificant storage! I go to setting to clear some stuff but it still won’t work! I hope you guys can fix that buggy! Overall, it’s a great app! There are a lot of music and filters etc.!"
"I personally think that this app is awesome as heck, but it may be confusing. Especially because I’m learning how to edit, it is very fun but this app makes it easier than other editing apps like IMovie and KineMaster. This app is the best ever, overall this is probably the best editing app EVER! If you are looking something easy, download this app right now.           -Fellow app user"
"So, I am an action movie editor for a friend of mine and I make movies with action genres all the time too, so the gun effects were perfect for the action movies but can someone please tell me why they removed them. Creator I would take it as a humongous favor if you would help me if it is a big or please put the sound effects back in because we made a 30 minute long movie the other day and now, we don’t have any affects to put in the movie. So please do it or if it’s a bug please help me."
"I been on cap-cut for a while I love all there effects and how you can add them to make them to make them look even look but I think l they should add more thing I think cap-cut should check out ae and video star but some stuff I think that should add is hex blur , better transitions , more effects , more overlays to choose from , cubes , triangles.. more shapes and better quality."
"I love this app so much, and love the shortcut mode. It helps a lot for beginners like me. The only thing I think it really needs is an option to search up specific songs. I don’t have the money to add songs onto my phone and sometimes I wish there were a few more song choices. Other than that, I love this!"
"See I use this app to make edits for my TikTok account. I love it it’s so easy to use. There is one thing though, you see I’m a very organized person and like to have thing in folders. It would be awesome if they added folders so you you wouldn’t have to go searching to find the edit. It would just be in a folder. But otherwise I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE APP!!"
"I’ve used a lot of great editing apps, but this one is best out of all of them! It had NO WATERMARK, amazing effects, and very simple to use! Now you got to admit if you use this app, it’s pretty great! My videos I make have improved a lot, and by a lot I mean a lot! I had to give it a five star rating! It’s really good for YouTubers! So I promise everyone will love this amazing editing app!"
It’s really good but when I added pictures and made a massive edit for ME!!!It got deleted when I added new pictures for my kakeguri edit and I wish you can add some things like voice effects and like you can do how fast and how slow you want your effects but moving on with my edit I’m very good at this app and I don’t want to find another app because those are so HARD TO USE!!Just fix that bug because it’s happening a lot
Better Than any Other editing app But really need more effects and I love it so much I get on it everyday trust me it’s the best And they Do new effects everyday I’m so happy my Fav app🥺🥺 I use it everyday and can y’all add trippy effects and more effects like Viedo star and new stuff Plz🥺 Love y’all have to get this app rn And you need to add where we can record from the app And the jiggle effect thank you💕
"This app is perfect for making edits, and I’ve been making a lot lately, however there is an issue with adding audio. I would click on the option to place in a sound from TikTok and it would say error loading, whether or not I’m offline or even connected to internet, can you please get that fixed please?"
"Capcut is a very good app. But... It makes me delete my pictures and videos and even if I delete 10 they still confirm me about my storage I now have less pictures and videos and I think you should fix some bugs please. Thank you.

                                                           -Olivia, From Nigeria"
"I love Capcut! I can tween and everything in this! But the Chroma Key is the only issue, and the tweening can get a bit wonky. I kinda wish that we could choose a area we dont want to be apart of the chrome key, like if we have a character with green eyes and we use a green screen, the eyes disappear with it. So this is a hurdle what is pretty hard to get over…

But besides these issues i have found, 10/10!"
"Ok so ive been using this app for a while but I had to delete it,the reason why is because I have recently had a lot of pictures and videos in my camera roll,so I decided to delete some, as I went back into capcut to see if the problem was fixed and still it was not, I hope you understand and fix the problem thank you and bye"
I went into CapCut and trying to edit stuff and wanted to put my saved tiktok sounds but it kept saying no internet connection please try again and I tried again and it won’t work I don’t want to like pre-record them my storage is about to go in max if I kept doing that so please fix it
"So I have been using this app for year's and it is amazing but there is a simple problem it's with the fonts one of the fonts name is ""Autism"" it makes me so mad that you could of used any name for that font but you used a disorder A DISORDER!!! it's just gross of you people to do that please change it it's ticking me off so much 😐"
"CC is a great mobile editor, lots of bells and whistles. I spent the last 4 hrs chipping away at something you used to have to do in final cut, which is pretty awesome.

However I used the built in sound library only to find within minutes of uploading to TikTok that I got a copyright strike. 

Music NEEDS to be clearly labeled if there is an exclusive copyright or it can be used. OR just make sure to get music that is free to use. It’s worthless otherwise"
"My friends had been doing edits and at first it didn’t appeal to me as it does now, this app is awesome like awesome, I know there maybe some bad reviews but trust me this app is great so much creativity, this app is great for beginners and even masters it’s great for all, now I love editing and it’s what I do in my spare time, thank you CapCut for making this app so great for all (download it you won’t regret)"
"It’s really good, I love the effect and how you can add text, but one small complaint, I feel like you should add more of a variety of songs, like K-pop and you should let people search up a song because they might not have it in their phone/iPad. So other than that this is an amazing app highly recommend if you are in love with making short videos/edits, but that’s the only complaint I have. But for now I’ll use this and Tempo."
"Honestly, I love capcut. At first I had trouble editing but until I found capcut, I started to become a better pro at editing. Capcut was also the first editing app I ever downloaded besides iMovie. I think it’d be better for you to add more animations to make the edits more better, and I also want you to add more effects just so there is a bit more."
"I’ve been using other apps to edit my dance videos until a friend asked me to get CapCut, I’m not sure there’s any other app in the world that’ll give you what CapCut offers and absolutely free😀Very easy to use and gives the best quality to your videos. Tbvh, this app deserves a 6 star rating. I love you guys and thank you 😊"
"I just downloaded Capcut a day ago but already I made 2 edits and when I try to play them (in the app) they will not play. Transitions, and the effects are good but I would suggest watching tutorials first. Like any editing app it is a bit complicated to learn at first like how to higher audio volume, but I think Capcut is an easier to learn editing app that is great. I would definitely suggest downloading Capcut."
"I was searching for a good free editing app, and this, IS AMAZING!!! I usually never review anything but THIS APP really deserves five stars. You are getting so many things for free. Everything is easy, and quick to used. I learned how to use a lot of the tools pretty fast. There are filters, stickers, text, ect, so much! You should really try this app when you get the chance. I LOVED IT!!!"
"I really liked the app because it was very convenient to use. But after the new update, I can’t just use any feature of the app. Whenever I tap on any transitions, animations or any effects, it tells me that I don’t have an internet connection and I have to connect to one when I clearly have a good internet connection. I even tried using the app with VPN on but it still doesn’t work. Please do something! I really loved this app."
"Hi capcut, I love this app. Though, i don’t have much space on my phone so trying to start a new project is rough. What i would like to have is the ability to press on past projects to check which ones i would like to delete to free up some space. That’s all, everything else is great. Please just give us the ability to click on projects even when we can’t start a new project, so we can free up some space. Thank you!!"
I like the app a lot and I love to edit with it but there is a huge problem that I need fixed. Every time I make a small edit it takes up a huge amount of storage. I only made a few edits and it’s already taking up 11 gigabytes. And when my storage is full it’s always that app. When it’s full the app doesn’t let me open my edits. I need to see what edit is is to see if i can delete it. I don’t understand why it takes up so much storage but I want it fixed.
I love this app it’s amazing but there is barely any music to pic from that will fit with the vid I’m making. Plus I can’t find the right music I want my vid to be and it’s kind of irritating and if one frame is to small I can’t go back and fix it but other than that I love this app so much!!!
"I honestly love Capcut and can edit so easily on it, but lately I’ve been having exporting problems. Every time I go to export a video it only gives me half of the video and stops at the first clip. Just today I worked on an edit for 2 hours and it came out all mixed up and the text was completely jumbled into the wrong places as well as the photos and clips. Please fix this glitch and I know it’s happening to others as well. Thank you."
"I've been using this app for quite some time and it's been going well until it tells me to clean up phone storage, i deleted some photos and it told me the same thing, i ended up deleting almost all the apps i've had and all the photos from my camera roll and it still told me to clean up storage, i don't know what is wrong with this app, but i can't use this anymore, i wasted my time deleting photos and edits i've been working on for nothing, don't waste your time using an app that tells you to clean up phone storage like this one."
i was editing a video and when i tried to save it it said i didn’t have a bough storage so i cleared some pictures out and went to settings and i literally had 15gb ? i even deleted all my other edits on the app bc i thought maybe that would work but it was saying the same thing still. then u thought i would just start over on what i was editing but it doesn’t even let me do that so i un-installed the app and redownloaded it but it STILL doesn’t let me do anything. i’m really disappointed because i like this app but it’s doing this for some reason.
"I love this app 100%! But the thing is that “You insufficient storage” when clearly I have a lot of storage, that is the only thing that bothers me. Other than that it’s perfectly fine, and I would recommend it, oh one more thing.. If you guys could let use put more screenshots without the app glitching, that would be a MASSIVE help. But yeah again other than that this app is amazing!"
"capcut is so good i love it, it doesn’t have any water marks, ads, and it doesn’t cost money. like other apps you have to unlock effects by buying it but everything is free on this plus it has no water marks. i love is smmm. i downloaded this app cause i saw somebody posted a tutorial how to use it on Tik tok and its not hard like video star plus nothing cost money!!"
But I feel they should give us more than presets I feel like we should be able to make our own transitions. I know they have some but they look choppy. But I feel like they should add more things to make your own transitions. But other that I love this app so much so many things you can do with this and everything is free. I feel like this app is very underrated.
"Don’t get me wrong I LOVE this app, it’s easy, gives you the option to remove the watermark, and it’s worked perfectly up until now...I get my audio clips from TikTok to edit and it’s always worked but this time it doesn’t. For ex) one of my audios had 25 seconds on it but when I went to put it on capcut it cut the audio down to 6 seconds ?! It’s so frustrating, I deleted the app and reinstalled it so many times but it’s still like that ?"
"i really like this app and use it for my edits as its the only free option i have! however i'd really like a way to be able to add smooth transitions between overlays like you can with the maintrack. an issue i've also noticed is when using the transition feature on the maintrack, the buttons become too small to press and you can't select a clip."
"Yes I am going to be one of those people who says they don’t write reviews, because I don’t, but this app is so useful and fun to edit with, you don’t have to pay money which I appreciate so much and the app itself has so many features. The only bad thing I would say is, it can be a bit glitchy sometimes. Keep up the great work devs!"
"this is really one of the simplest, easy to use, yet powerful editing apps i have ever use. it has a lot of great features, especially for transitions and animations, and not confusing like other apps are. i’ve used this app a lot over the past week to edit videos for that one tiktok trend :)

the only thing that i would add to the app is keyframes, so that the animations can be as smooth and flawless as possible. i’ve tried out several other apps that have keyframes, but i keep coming back to capcut because it’s easier to use. please consider adding this feature! i’m sure it could help me and many other users :) thank you!"
"Not sure if there was update or what triggered it, but it was wonderful to use and easy to create great videos for so long…. Until something triggered the audio and video to misalign so badly that it’s impossible to use the app anymore. I don’t even have to edit the file, it’s already corrupted as soon as I import it. So, other than being completely unusable at the moment, this app is otherwise really great."
"It’s an amazing app and stuff but I have three edits on the page and deleted all my photos and still telling me that my storage is full, and need update. I updated, still didn’t work. And I add 60fps but nothing changes and when I put some overlays and stuff it lags so much. Such a great app but it really ruins the quality of my videos or/and photos"
"I LOVE THIS APP it’s so good and easy to work with, people say its not and editing app which i agree but disagree. I think it’s not and editing app because it doesn’t have the things to make a profesional edit. I think capcut should just add graphs and mirroring edges (or whatever they are called). Those are the only things i recommend, but i still love this app and will still always use it!"
"This app is absolutely amazing I’ve been using it for a long time now. I’m pretty sure like 6 month’s. It’s free! It’s amazing and it has a lot of features that you can use after all it’s a very good editing app! You can add the videos onto other apps, and it has very nice effects and features to use for beginners."
"I LOVE(d) CapCut but all of a sudden it says I cannot edit because I need to allow access to albums, I click on it, it brings me to settings, and I try everything on my settings, it still doesn’t go away. I recommend getting the app but have fun with it while it lasts, I hope a bug like that doesn’t pop up for your. Other then that, it’s super amazing but I’m so angry because that’s the only app I fully knew how to use so I’m not sure what im gonna do😭😭😭😭😭"
"I wasn’t very good at editing at all. And that was mainly because i used Video Star, once I started using the app though. MY FRIENDS LOVED MY EDITS!! The only downside I have is the fact that you need to be online to use a lot of things. If you’ve used them before you can use them online, which I think is pretty cool! 😄 Thank you CapCut for making me a happy girl!!!!"
"So...first off what I got to say is.
I barely have apps on my phone! So every time I wanna edit something on capcut it says my storage is full I delete an app then I only have 3-4 apps left then it work but i shouldn’t have to do that my camerroll isn’t even that much full to where CapCut should say that-
But after all CapCut is a very good editing app for no payment I really like I just hate the storage part cause no editing app does that but CapCut and that’s a shame 
Ps.. PLEASE FIX THAT PROBLEM TY😗✌🏾"
Ok so I do the template stuff and I’m just looking at the edits and stuff. All I do is that then it goes slow but I try pressing it again and it says “free up phone storage” I just barely got on there though. And I have enough storage. It’s making me mad cause just for this I have to delete everything. I’m losing my stuff. I thinking of deleting it after all that hard work.
I have this app on my phone and the animations don’t work. It always says that I have unstable internet connection and I fix my WiFi and it still says that. None of the previews for the animations show either. I also have it on my I pad and it works perfectly. Like what?? The 2 devices are on the SAME wifi so I don’t really know anymore.  I love using it for funny edits and it’s awesome. I don’t know what it is.
"This app is the perfect app for editing.  Its really nice for tiktoks and other stuff.  Although it needs some more things in it, what i mean by that is like maybe better quality and some other stuff that people add to make their video nice. This app is really amazing I use it everyday! I would recommend getting this app."
"Okay well yes, this app is great! I use it for all my edits and videos. I just have a suggestion. So, I know how you can but overlays and everything? I wonder if you could put multiple overlays at once. Just a concept, because whenever I try to add more then one overlay I have to choose one. Overall, this app is outstanding."
"Overall my experience is really good! No watermark and it’s all free! The transitions could use work, but there really good. I would like to see a motion blur that you can add on moving layers, text etc. that would make the app 10x better! I also would like to see custom transitions where you can save them as a custom transition preset type thing."
This app is the best editing app there is so far but one time it wasn’t working so I deleted it then got the app back and my stuff and all the videos I edited were gone so I had redo everything could you make it where you have an account so it saves your stuff or anything that saves your progress please?
"This app is pretty good! I love all the features and the quality. I’d rate this app 10/10! So why did I give it 4 stars? Well, it’s not necessary the app. It’s the updates. On TikTok, I see all these people using the “Auto Velocity” feature. I’ve updated my capcut more than once and I still don’t have the feature. The feature would really be helpful for the types of edits I make."
"Capcut is absolutely amazing! Easy to use, built in transitions! (Even available to make your own) MULTIPLE LAYERS!! They dont even have a watermark! May i add the app is FREE?-
The stickers are also amazing! And even put in your own music (Thankful for the video import feature!) I recommend this for starter editors but i mean everyone can use it! Im experienced editor yet capcut is so useful!"
"So i got this app yesterday. This app is The best video editing app i’ve downloaded it’s free and has some awesome features! Today when I went to get on the app, I went to click the video I was editing, and the app froze. I tried refreshing going in and out, But nothing worked. I’m not sure if it’s my phone or the app, I just wanted to finish the edit I was doing because so far I put a lot of effort into it and i don’t want to restart..."
"This is literally such an amazing editing app, im literally super stupid and basically gave up on editing after trying after effects. But this app is super user friendly and even a dummy like me can make the edits that i think about. It has so many cool effects and easy to understand. Thanks for making this amazing app, im a die hard fan♡"
"Love this app for editing! only problem is that now when i used the overlay feature and removed the background, it took out much more than just the green screen. This is happening in videos which i have removed the background of before, but have been just fine."
"God. this app literally like physically angers me, if you want to move fast, you can’t since the app is poorly made. its super inconsistent. i have an audio set and even at the same timestamp another part of the audio will play compared to the original part that it was, if i try to make a movement later on into the video i have to slowly start in the beginning for the audio to render again, and you cant even scroll past it or wait for it to catch up because it wont ever render. this is on an iphone 12. find another one. hot garbage"
I was a little bit intimidated at first because I thought it would be difficult because I see all of these YouTubers making videos with insane edits but I’ve been using this for a few months now and it’s so easy and it’s really helped build my confidence and imagination with editing
"Like the title CapCut is an amazing app for editors to make what they please! There are a lot of things to do there but the one thing i want to touch’s on is overlay it changed A LOT like is you would slide it to one it was literally almost gone and its not smooth as it used to be I’m not sure if it’s just the phone I’m using or something wrong with it but yea. 

Have a good day thank you for reading this!"
"This app is simply amazing. My friend told me to use this app to edit vids, and so I tried it. I didn’t know what I was doing at first, but I got the hang of it later on, with no video at all. It was easy for me, idk for anyone else, but yes it’s awesome. The editing is awesome, and yea that’s all I have to say. I really recommend getting this app if you want to make videos."
"I’m a gacha animator, and i used to use kinemaster for everything, but using Capcut is sooo much easier. Everything is smoother and you can find stuff more easily. There are also more effects and animations then there are in kinemaster, along with things that aren’t in kinemaster. 10/10 recommend, as it is very good editing software"
CapCut is amazing for editing my videos or pictures but when I try adding a picture a lot of times I have to go to settings to allow it cause it doesn’t allow my to access! And when I make a very tiny period it does not show until I save it into my camera role and that is very annoying and I want those to be fixed because I cannot tell if it’s right or wrong when I can’t see if I made a mistake or not and I am very annoyed at that
"I was so happy when I first got it and don’t look back I have been an editor for 2 years now yes there are some bugs when you try and do the lens blur trend but overall good editing app

I think cap cut should add lens blur and not have us do this hacks to do lens blur it would make me happy and a lot more editors because not everyone can get AE"
"It’s an amazing app with great features I definitely recommend, you can even get rid of the end card which I really like, the only problem is with the key frames, when you first start using key frames everything is fine, but after a couple of frames it refuses to work, I hope it will soon get fixed"
So is good and all and it’s really helping me out with videos and edits but there’s one small problem whenever I use CapCut for too long it starts to lag and the frames get stuck in place whenever is the next Frame but that’s OK so I just had to delete it and re-download it and it was fixed
"App is great. Definitely recommend for editors who can’t afford software. However, I am a bit upset that the background noise reducer doesn’t work, regardless of the video or audio I try to use it on. I wouldn’t have an issue if I could find other apps to remove the background noise of videos for, but there aren’t any free ones. Hopefully they fix this soon."
"I’ve been using this app and I love it 
I’ve been making lyric videos with this app 
And I’ve been wanting to have a constant animation while having a start and end animation on a text 
So it can make the videos more defined 
But I rate this app 10/10 it’s perfect for a beginner very easy to use as well"
"All I want to say is, please let us be able to put more then just 6 overlays. I’m trying to tween and with only 6 it’s not complete. And when you’re putting effects and there’s an overlay,can we please have an option to either if we wanna have the effects on the overlay or not. That would help a lot!"
"So I was going around App Store and saw this, it’s a very useful app it’s just that it always says “fix storage” or whatever and I deleted some of my pics and it still said it, it’s super annoying like I cant even go look at a video I made! Anyways this is a very good app for Gacha life players and other stuff so definitely recommend"
This app is amazing because it makes my videos look even better and there’s a lot of options to choose from and I pick different kinds of choices and I post them on TikTok and I get a lot of likes and it’s m only a kid so it just makes me really really happy to have a lot of likes on all of my videos
"I gave it a 5 star because the app is really great and easy to use but all all of a sudden the animations started getting laggy and not working right, I’m not sure why and I’m caught up on all the updates too. Maybe just a small bug but otherwise great app! And I love how easy it is to edit everything!!"
"Hi my name is zahra! Overall I LOVE this app. So many Greta features like Texts, Effects, Songs and MUCH more! But what I don’t like about it is that when you have no space you can’t make anything. And one time I had lots of space in my iPad, but it said something like “no iPad storage” so yeah overall I recommend this app if you have a yt channel or just for fun :) I rate it a 4!"
"I’ve been needing something to make editing my videos easier, and my friend recommended CapCut to me. So far, it’s amazing! I haven’t really figured out all the features yet, but the ones I’ve used are great! It makes putting my videos together so much easier!! The fact that it’s free is also amazing! This is an amazing app in my opinion."
I had been using this app for maybe a month and it was ok. I was cleaning out my photos to make room. Then I opened up capcut and tried looking at a few videos but every time it said Insufficient Storage. I continued to delete more and more photos and now I have very few but it still says Insufficient Storage. Then I decided to delete and re install capcut. It still said Insufficient Storage. So now I have to find a new video editor because I can’t use capcut. I was actually starting to like it.
"This app is just great. I’m able to edit videos for free and add transitions, sound, effects, text, and more. And there’s no watermark! But I feel like it’s missing some stuff.

The audio is great. There’s lots of sounds and music. But I use capcut a lot for music videos where I pick a song and make a video outa it. But not a lot of the songs have actual singing in it,
 It’s mostly just background music.

Maybe a drawing option? Since I’m an artist, sometimes I like to use my drawings in a project. But to do that I have to draw something, save it, and import it to capcut. And a lot of times it’s just a simple sketch which takes like 15 secs to draw. I feel like this would really be helpful."
"Don’t get me wrong, I love capcut- but sometimes when I try to make an edit it keeps saying I have to clear storage- even tho I barely have photos- so I get mad sometimes bc It won’t let me make anything- over all it’s a good editing app I love the effects and everything- but it’s just that- that’s bothering me. But I love the app I recommend!"
"This app is great, I love it. I use it every day to make edits. Every other app I’ve tried to use has so many things that you need to buy, and there’s barely anything you can do without buying premium. But this one’s great! And there are so many effects, animations, transitions, filters, stickers, and more! It’s also so easy to use, it’s not complicated at all. I recommend this app to everyone."
I absolutely LOVE capcut. There are a few things that stop me from editing though. The transitions stopped working after a few days and I can only use the ones I’ve used before. When I try the other ones it tells my that my internet connection isnt working. I think it’s a bug because the ones I’ve used before work perfectly fine.
"This app helps me with editing! I love the options it gives you! Even an undo button :0! Life changer! Get this app! It helps soooo much!  Just a thing, when your editing if your like me, I love editing tons, and tons, and tons. So if your life me it’s kinda time consuming. But after it feels so good and you love the thing you just made! Request this app!"
"I like the app CapCut. My friend introduced this CapCut and I Like it a lot! One problem is. Everytime my storage is full why do I have to delete apps? I only have 5 apps for real. Can you please fix? And also, it would be greatful if you add fonts, I know there are some fonts but can you do fonts that you can download from? Thanks! 🔥 keep up great work"
"Ong I love this app and it’s great! I’m really happy that there is NO watermarks and there so much things you can do with it! It’s definitely great and I suggest you should try it if you have not, and also what I like about this app is that it has many different effects and ALOT if animation. I’ve been using this for a long time now and when ever I do edits, I go on there and I LOVE OT😋"
"Now I’ve used a lot of editing apps in my life, and Capcut is by FAR the best one I’ve ever used. It gives you a variety of things for editing without you having to pay at all. However, there is one bug that’s causing me to rate 2 stars. Even if you select certain photos to be able to be used in editing, certain ones won’t show up to import into the edit. This is a huge problem and makes editing with this app almost impossible."
"This is a very good app and all but for some reason my effects, overlays, filters, edit, text, stickers, etc. isn’t working and I tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling and it still won’t work I really wanna use your app I love this but I can’t do anything if this isn’t working I rate it five stars bc I love this but can you fix it pls."
I love the app but you can only export the video if it is 15 minutes Long so that make hard to do some stuff and I wish there was a way to make a time lapse but there isn’t and I wish there was some more music they have a lot but I wouldn’t put them in any of my videos just A personal preference but I love the app if that got added I would love it more and if that change to.💖😊
"Imma start off by saying that it is a really great app, but i have recently ran into a problem. Some videos that I edit will always “Fail to export”, and no matter how many times I try it always fails to export right at the end. It can’t possibly be my connection as the blame because i keep a steady connection. I just hope there is a way to fix the issue so i can export them finally instead of letting them sit and rot. Thank you 🙏🙏"
"This editing app is amazing! Ive been using it for almost a year now. (you should download it if your a beginner) Theres one problem though, the problem is that the style button isnt showing up. I tried to do everything but it still doesnt show. Please fix this bug but everything else is perfectly fine!"
so basically I wanna be a roblox editor and this is what I need it has the perfect effects and it had the effect I have been looking for.  I love this app whoever thinks it’s bad is seeing things.  This app has all the effects everyone needs.  You should download it.  It’s worth it trust me they have velocity and much more special effects for your videos.
"I love this app so much… it’s awesome but then I really suggest capcut makes it possible to keep your data even after deleting the app 
I mean make it possible to create an account to store all your videos in even when the app is deleted… other than that this app is awesome and definitely really recommended!"
"Yes I mean EVERYONE!! This app is amazing I use it literally every day every night every minute (#addicted) I love how you can add your own music and use music it already provides!! I’ve been looking for a video making app that’s good for decades now 
I finally found one!! I want to say a huge thank you for not really having ANY in app purchases!! Sincerely, I satisfied customer!!"
Hey!! I really love this app but hate that it isn’t on a computer and would love if it was still tryin learn I’m a starter but love the app so for but really wish it was on a computer because I only switch now and find it a bit hard to use on a phone. But over all it’s a very good app and would very much so recommend!!
"Ok, first, yes. Just, lovely. But- can y’all add more lqbtqia+ stickers..? That would be nice :) uhm anyways, there rly is nothing wrong with this app- I use it for anime and DSMP edits- and it actually works better then I thought it would.. *flash backs to IMovie* oh, and can u plsssssssssssssssssssssss add the rat filter? Ty :) also, can there be more transitions and animations? Kinda limited there 🤠 also, with the auto text thing can u make it so it puts captions to songs? I make edits for tiktok and YT and I wanna put captions without taking 5 mins of my life to type them out ｡ﾟ(ﾟ´ω`ﾟ)ﾟ｡ laziness~ uhm but overall CapCut is good. I MAKE NO SENSE I AM SO SORRY"
"Yes, you heard me. This editing app is so amazing, and has no bounds. One thing that bugs me, though, is that you cannot watch any of your creations when your “storage is full”. This is the only reason that this has a four star rating. Everything else-from the millions of creations to learn from, to the amazing sound effects + visual effects. 

9.6/10, love it!"
This app is so good but the only thing that could make it better is an account option where if you accidentally delete the app all of your edits will be there when you log into your account and if there is an account option please tell me how to access it
"I love CapCut, there are so many possibilities of things you can create with the app and you can do it all. The one issue I have is with cropping images. For some reason if I try to crop the image into a format, the image doesn’t stay cropped. It has only worked in one of my projects and I would like to know why. Overall though, highly recommend using CapCut."
"I just want to say, this app is great, I would marry it if I could! LOL. And it’s great to make edits with, but I would really love more transitions and stuff. All of them are getting kind of boring.. but the animation ones are great too. And I just think this is a good app in general, but it probably does need a few fixing here and there, but I would definitely download it!!!"
"I loved it I used to use KineMaster so much it is very easy 
And so many options for stickers and I love it and very easy
You can animate and stuff I’m a gachatuber and I’m sofiscated I do full body animations and there’s a small problem when I try to full body animate after 6/7 overlays it says maximum overlay tracks which I just want fixed"
"This is a great beginner app it's really easy too use. People bash it, but that's really not a problem. Though I do think the slomo is a bit choppy I still like it. I never get frustrated while doing a edit except for when you have the storage problem thing but that would be my fualt. So overall I rate this a 5"
I have always wanted a yt channel and recently found out how to record. But I didn’t know how to edit talk about having editing apps then I downloaded yours and it was the BEST you can have effects filters cut crop do anything you want it is perfect for a beginner you are very talented making this app and I would like to thank j for being in this world:)
So I like this app! I make videos with it and there’s something confusing when I look at the Home Screen where I see all the videos I make on the bottom of the video it has a number and the letter M Is it like I have million lovers or maybe something else could you just ask me about it?
"This app is AMAZING!!! There was just one problem. I was try to edit vids and for a while the effects worked but then on day it wouldn't download the effect and say ""no internet connection"" even though I have strong internet. I deleted the app and re downloaded it, now it works perfectly but it would've been a problem if I had more than one project."
"This is the BEST app for editing but there are A LOT of glitches with the key frames and if you doing a lot of editing on your videos, when playing them over again the video glitches and slows down and lag. Great app but I hope future fixes happen soon!"
I downloaded this a long time ago thinking it was perfect and it was! I made funny gaming videos with my brother. But the problem is.. I accidentally deleted it today. I lost all my videos and the funny moments with my brother. When I downloaded it again i thought it would come back. The reason why I am reporting this is because I really need an account for capcut and I’m sure other people would want that too.
So yes I know capcut it awsome but the the problem is I cant get it because my version is 10.3 and it's 4.23 I think so can you please change the version so I can get it and my device is not compatible with this app because of the version so can u lower it like to 9.3 so I can get it please I beg u please!!! Keep the good work!!!!!!! ;)
"I downloaded this app (I don’t remember why) and haven’t used it. For whatever reason I started recently and I’m impressed with it. Has a lot of features that it’s hard to replicate if you don’t have the templates in other apps. The only thing I don’t like it that u can import music from Documents or other platforms, yes u can do iTunes. But if I could import other music it would be A+"
"For anyone who is a beginner with editing, this would be your app. I don’t get any glitches, and the app is completely free. I love this app, honestly. I see no flaws. CapCut has everything you need. Filters, animations, overlays, amazing fonts, and more. Overall, easy 10/10 editing app. You can do everything with this!"
"I love it but there is a bug. I added a sticker and all of a sudden it got removed when I exported the video. I put good quality on a video and when I exported it, it was all black just a black screen. Please fix this! Other than I think it should have more shaking and flashing effects. Please fix these things!"
"I LOVE THIS APP it’s really great a lot of effects! Filters,songs,stickers, etc. I had made a lot of videos! I really really love this app I get on it every day but one day it had lost all my videos I put a lot of time into making those videos I am really mad!😩I totally recommend you get it! But Idk how to fix this!!

Edit: I got my videos back some how"
"this app is awesome, i’ve just recently discovered it and it has way more features than my old app i used, inshot. Although, i will say inshot was a bit easier to use and i would definitely recommend it to begginers. tbf tho, i just got this app, so i could discover some issues, but so far, i have had no problems!"
"This is app is reallyyyyyy good for starters they have so many transitions,flashes,effects,and etc!I recommend you to use Capcut  if you’re new to editing!And it’s free and there are no items that you can purchase, it’s all free.!Although it may be very laggy on longer videos but other than that I recommend this app for starters."
So I been make lots of TikTok’s right and I think CapCut should have a velocity button because if that did you guys could possibly beat other editing apps because on CapCut everything is free and if they had free velocity everybody would be using CapCut because you don’t need a subscription just to use certain stuff
"So my wife stopped working for awhile and I was ok but then,when it came back on I wanted edit a video for my cat and I connected my TikTok sound list to CapCut so I went to check it so I can use a sound,but it said no internet an my wifi was working at the time so I pressed to so it can refresh but,IT STILL didn’t work! So I have to delete CapCut lose all my videos and connect CapCut back to my TikTok and it’s annoying 🥱"
I’ve used capcut for almost all of my edits I’ve ever made and it is definitely one of the best editing apps out there. Overall it is great but I have one major suggestion- is there anyway to make the blur 2 fade out effect any faster? If so it would be super helpful for making my edits! Love capcut💞
"I like cap cut a lot but sometimes animating it or trying to scale and move overlays are just annoying! Today for example I was editing and had to move a overlay that was sideways to animate it. For some reason the overlay went all the way to the other side of the video, then when I tried to put it back it just would not stay still! It was like it had a will of it’s own."
"So, I’ve been editing with CapCut for a while, and everything was fine, until a couple days ago. I was trying to edit a video, and when I tried to use the slider to move my video, it kept turning it into one small clip and move the whole thing, and when I split it, it just moved the rest of the video with it, can someone help me please?"
"The app is amazing! It is clearly well made and has a lot of effects/transitions to choose from! It’s great to use whether you’re a beginner or professional! To me, this is on par with other great apps out there or may even be better! I honestly find this app to be underrated and should definitely be recognized and recommended to everyone!"
"I was using the go pro app to edit my videos but that platform is very difficult when it comes to downloading videos, but with Capcut there is no problem at all. Although capcut is somtimes hard to get used to you will get the hang of it and make amazing things :) so get this app and lets see your cool videos!"
I think this app is great but I feel like their should be a option for velocity edits in speed so that it automatically slows the video down and speeds up like a normal velocity edit would. Also PLEASE add a effect that enhances the lighting of the original video/photo. And other than that the app is pretty great and to me doesn’t need anymore improvements.
"It’s an amazing app and i’ve edited many videos on it but now it keeps saying ’Couldn’t Import, please try again later’ which i do. I reopen the app and wait a while but i still doesn’t let me upload the videos i want to add. 😔 I genuinely like this app and it helped me edit videos, please respond so i can know what’s wrong. For now, i’ll try restarting my phone till it works. 🙂"
This is an amazing app! Even though I deleted a bunch of my edits and photos in my camera roll and it says “try to clear up some storage and try again” and I even bought more storage on my phone and it still says I need more storage. I don’t know if it’s a bug or not but I can’t fix it
"I have had CapCut for a long time to edit my videos and Im in love! CapCut has many transitions I use for my edits! Even if CapCut gets hate, I will still love it! I have never seen such a good editing app before! I do wish you could change the voice to speech text to have a spanish accent or something like that! But overall I love CapCut!"
Hey I LOVE your app but my problem is when I edited one day and there was a post on tik Tok thing so I clicked it but it restarted my tik Tok and it logged me out of my accounts so idk if it’s just me but I used it agin the other time and when I wanted to get on tik tok it restarted the whole thing AGAIN so pls fix this bug ty!Pls answer
"this app is INSANE, SO GOOD FOR EDITING! WITH NO STUPID PREMEIUM THING! if your looking for a mobile editing app this one is for you, first of all, with this app, you can slow down anything you want, second, you can edit using the split button, cut out what ever you want, third, well, just download the app and see ;), this app has so much to offer :)."
I love how it has so much features to use! and unlike like video star we have to all the make all the effect but here we only tap on the effect and it puts it on for us I’m not trying to be rude I’m any way to video star but I love this app more and plus video star we have to pay money  unlike capcut we don’t have to pay
"The app is incredible and has helped me gain over 300 followers on TikTok, but all of a sudden it is not allowing to go back to edit videos saved on the app due to “insufficient storage” when it had no problem letting me use it when I already had terrible storage on my phone. It is 100 percent free and I totally recommend. Be careful with your storage I was able to make about 6 videos before the app said something about it"
Okay so this app is really amazing like the title says itself. And to top it off you can do a bunch of stuff FOR FREE! You can get a membership I think if you would like but for being free it’s great! It’s really good for editing starters I definitely recommend this app to anyone that’s trying to edit a video of any sort! Very helpful app I love it❤️
"I found this app and I thought “might as well try it” 

This is probably one of the best editing apps I’ve ever gotten. It has great assets and even music! Most of the ones I've gotten costed money to make it good quality. This is completely free with pretty good quality. It’s has built in stickers and great transitions! I love it so much! Thanks for this app!"
"So here’s the story, I was thinking about editing. So I wanted to do a velocity edit. I am a beginner editor so I don’t know how to do it on my own so I wanted to do auto velocity in style. Then. I realized. There was no style! I couldn’t do auto velocity in style. I checked every single button and  there was no style. I don’t think anybody had This problem but I have. Can you fix it?"
"Before this app became CapCut, you could edit videos with ease and then save them to your phone. Now when you go to export them, it ONLY lets you upload them to tiktok. Tiktok is a crap platform. I have never used it and never will. When you “export” the video, it says it saved it as a project AND to your device, but it only saves it as a project and does not save them to your device, which means you either have to share them on tiktok or don’t share them it all. Uninstalled. Will be looking for a new app. This one went to hell."
"I think CapCut is good, you can edit however you want and put amazing filters but there is just one problem. It always says that I don’t have enough storage and that I need to clean it out I can’t delete everything on my phone for editing. I also would love to have name stickers and you can just search your name up and there it is."
I have used this app for a while then I got funimate still great I just crop of the watermark so I don’t have to pay I still use CapCut and I also combine them together (my tiktok is “hayhayedits”) if anyone wants it but yea the app is wonderful love everything it does it’s amazing uhm so I hope everyone has a great rest of their day/night! :)
"Hi I’ve used CapCut for over a year now, I’m a fanpage on tiktok and I use it for my coloring on iPhone, I used vignette for my coloring yesterday following the steps and I tried using it today and it seems that it updated to where when I use it it looks extremely different and very bad which ruins the entire video, I was hoping that you guys could fix this problem immediately because it’s not good at all, so yea I’m eating this a 2 because it’s not fixed and it looks horrible."
"This app is super easy to use and makes video editing come easy. My only issue so far is that even on wifi, I am unable to sync my own sounds to the videos I make. Even after updating and redownloading the app. Hopefully an update that corrects this problem comes along soon so I can keep editing my videos."
"I love this app very much! I do lots of edits on it and make so many fun videos! The one thing I don’t like about this app is it needs more text to speech voices. There are only 3 and not very good. Also, the voice changer voices sound the same. Chipmunk, elf, and high, all sound the exact same. So what I’m saying is, add more text to speech voices and change the voice changer! The rest of this App is amazing!"
"This is a very good app for editing. I just have one minor problem. The max amount for overlays. I used about 5-7 overlays for tweening, and when I’m about to add the last few capcut says that I can’t add any more overlays. I’m not saying get rid of the max overlay thing completely, but maybe make the number to maybe 10-12 overlays? Other than that, capcut is a really good app."
This is definitely a five star editing app. This is amazing because it has no watermark and you can make things so very smooth. It is very easy to use and edit with. Only downside is that the text needs to be able to make actual animations and stuff like that but overall five ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
"Best app I’ve seen in a very long time, this app includes very good features, effects, transitions, and many more items in this amazing app! Try it out for yourself! This is amazing! I’m not a bot ether lol. People sometimes are bots putting reviews, but I really love this app and people should use it more!
     Love - //Peachie~Mochi// (Pinterest)"
"I love it a lot and my yt channel is grow bc of it, but sometimes when I try the ‘shortcut’ it tells me it’s unavailable or I have to try again later :l it also can be a bit difficult when you are trying to find a specific filter and have to hop it will pop up when you refresh. Great app, again tho"
"I’ve been using CapCut for a while now and honestly, I love this app. From the effects, the simplicity, and even the similarity it has to Alight Motion regarding the keyframes. The reason I give it 4 is because there are keyframes without graphs, which kind of defeats the purpose of them. I’d definitely suggest adding graphs so people who make their transitions using keyframes can be either slower or faster depending on the graph."
"It’s a good app and I use it quite a lot. I don’t know if this is a problem for just me or others though, whenever I go to use text it no longer gives me the option to change the opacity. I used to be able to change it and have to problems but now it is just faded out and I can’t change it. I would appreciate it if someone could help me with this issue"
"I've been using this app for a good 6 months now, and it is absolutely great compared to other apps. I like my videos to be nice and crisp, so i record in 4K. But on capcut, you can't upload your videos in 4k which is a bummer. I'd appreciate it if the Capcut app could support uploading in 4k. It would make this app perfect.
Thanks in advance!"
"So I love this game I’ve had it for 2 years or 3… but I don’t care really,….but overall I love this app but it sometimes freezes or glitches for me idk if it’s my phone or something but yea is a great app I love it so much but yea that’s just what I wanted to say but to everyone that see’s this hope you have a good day/night/afternoon/evening bye!"
Very good beginners app! I love the fact it saves progress! (Almost every editing app does) I had ABSOLUTELY ZERO idea how to put YOUR OWN MUSIC (record a video on what music you want put that in overlay your piece and done) but the storage for me it took up was LITERALLY 11.(something) GIBS. I ONLY MADE 2 VIDS AND IT TOOK UP THAT MUCH SPACE?! Are you joking?! But still very VERY good app.
This app is sooo good for Roblox transitions! I recommend getting it! There are so many filters and so many options to do with the movie your making! There is nothing I don’t like about this app! If you get this app you will def enjoy it! Now thanks for reading my short rating! I really had nothing to say about this! But have a great day!
"I downloaded this app a few minutes ago, and everything was completely accessible up until I got to the editor. After that, none of the things I clicked on were not compatible with voiceover and would not say anything when I clicked on them. This makes the app completely unusable for me other than creating a project and adding photos to the project. Please fix this as soon as possible."
"When I heard of this app, I doubted because I used other apps like splice and stuff. I thought this would disappoint me but it's better than all the other apps. Practically everything is free, there's so much things you can use. Though I am disappointed by the music thing it's perfect, I give it a 5 out of 5!"
I gave this a 3 because it’s good for making MINI edits but at some point it deleted all of my work i was able to redo some and idk if this is a limit but it kept saying I wasn’t allowed to export a 12 minute video although my phone had space until i deleted the rest it exported halfway threw then it said my phone had no space so then I recovered an older video that exported fine and it no longer worked but my phone has more storage then when I WAS able to export the video.
This app is awesome!! There is so many features that would take me hours to hand-do! It’s super easy and my videos turn out fabulous with this app! The only problem is in the beginning of my clip it will softly glitch and then things will go back to normal. I don’t know if it’s my phone or what but yeah. Everything else is great!!
"I’m under the age for it butttt, this app is freakin AWESOME it’s the best editing app! My life would be nothing without this! I love the app but.... it can use some changes, Like maybe no vip I would like that! And... More effects I would like more of the bling to me like Hearts and other stuff, it’s a pretty cool app, But I would add these changes straight away!"
CapCut is awesome. But I have been having issues getting in to my videos to edit them and to save them. It won’t let me scroll down in the video area anymore and it won’t let me press anything. The whole and has frozen completely. I love the app but I just need it to stop freezing.
"The amount of features on this app is incredible, and it free! it has so much, and this app is free! This is a great editing app for those who want to start although, I have a problem, I use shakes and it’s hard for me to put a lot, I have a suggestion for the creators, can you please add a feature where you can cut effects?"
"I’m so thankful i found this app on an instagram ad!! The animations & effects are incredible! I really wanted to start editing but almost all the professional editing apps make you pay. So thank you cap cut for making it easy for me! I highly recommend you get this app, it’s a life saver for all you instagram editors!!"
"I don’t know if you recently updated it but when I go to put text or copy text it reverts the text back to The default style.
Also text to speech pronounces “Gacha” weird. Also when you press play and editing voiceover and everything tend to stall. It’s making it difficult."
This app is a very easy way to edit video and fun to watch when your done!!! I think you should download because it make people happy. Another think you should reason why you should download it is because it not that long to edit to but I think you should download it.
"I love the app. But I kind of with the slow motion was more smooth for videos. Because when I try to make edits, the slow motion makes them look rough. Would love for you to fix that pls. Other than that, I love the app.

So update, I love the smooth slo mo but it takes so long to load. I literally have to wait at least  9 minutes for it to be at 63"
"I have so many problems with Capscut. Now here is the thing, Capscut is an amazing video editor and it has so many wonderful features. But after about 5 months now, it won’t work. It doesn’t let me go into the app, it wont let me export, audio delays, video quality gone down, crashes every 10-15 minutes, and overall lagging. I reinstalled it and made sure my wifi was the best but it’s not the device. It’s the application. Please fix this so I can go back to the wonderful 5 star app it was 5 months ago."
"Ok, so, I make Gacha videos and CapCut is great for that! But, whenever I try to edit or add a frame, it will say: ‘ insignificant phone storage.’ Even though I haven’t had many photos or pictures. I’ll go back and free up some space but, it will say the same thing. My iPhone storage is free and doesn’t have much. And some screen shots that were taken like 2 days ago, I can’t make a new clip. Is this a glitch or is something wrong with my iPhone?"
"When I was trying to edit a video, I wanted to do a velocity edit. But I don’t have the feature and I can’t update the app. So I was wondering if you can let me update the app and let me have the velocity feature like everyone else. I will appreciate it. Other then that the app is amazing and underrated."
"So this is amazing! I love this app a lot! You can make clips super short, and multiple different effects that look good in videos! One issue. The app can only hold 5 overlays. I feel like it should be able to hold more. There are a lot of apps that can hold like a billion layers and this can’t hold anything over six. But otherwise it’s a very good app for editing!"
"This is a great app. It is very easy for me to use! I highly recommend this app for video editing. 

If you would like a app that can help you edit videos this is the perfect app, I mean yeah it does have some downfalls like sometimes it does take some storage and a couple other thing but over all this is a great app."
"I found this app when I wanted to start making edits, and it’s very easy, simple, and not confusing. The only problem is limited overlays, but other than that it’s a very good editing app that I 100% would recommend if you’re trying to be an editor."
I love capcut it’s the best but I do wish that instead of remove background it would be something like ae where we can tap the screen and every second we can put what we wanna keep of the person instead of just doing remove background which doesn’t really work
"So this editor is positively FANTASTIC, be set free editor on iPhone 100%. However one complaint is that while recording voiceover, you have to hold down a button instead of just pressing it. Please change it to just pressing a button to start, and press again to stop."
"I love this app but I’ve noticed that the recent updates removed some of the sound effects I used to edit my videos. I would rather you all expand on the sound effects not take any away. For example, what happened to the bike bell in the “traffic” section of the sound effects; the punch sound in “fight” and many others. Please add those back!"
This app makes it so easy to edit I’m just 12 and can edit like a pro. You can do voice overs and make it stop at any time it has cool effects and you can find the right music for you video or picture. It even shows you where you can add some effects so I really recommend this
"Capcut is amazing, but I have a tiny complaint. When I clearly have enough storage space to make an edit, it says I don’t. This is really annoying when I’m trying to make edits! But overall, it’s probably the easiest app to edit with and no ads or anything! Tysm capcut for this experience to edit my days away!"
Amazing app! Just should be more adjustments for example maybe try upgrading effects I know you upgrade the effects a LOT but some I’m not very interested in but hopefully this isn’t a lot to ask for but if you could add a type of shading or water mark to shade anything you adding to edit it would be very helpful if that’s fine ?
"Ok so I downloaded this app so I could make the new trending roblox edit videos, and, let me just say, THIS APP IS AMAZING! I finished the edit video, and it looked SO much better than my other one with a different editing app! The areas where I cut out the video were clean and smooth, and the app had many different effects for free that I could use!"
Very good app! It’s really good and it has some good transitions. I just have a suggestion and a question. Can you add some more transitions because I make edits and I’ve been searching for apps with good transitions. But yeah I pretty much just said both anyway really good app. I use the app all the time when I am making an edit. Tysm for making this app!
"I have been looking for something like this for such a long time! This is my dream app because it’s completely free to use and has so many choices and possibilities. Please never change this because i literally almost gave up on video editing until I found this! Thx for an easy to use, free, and fun video editing app!!"
"I like the app its easy to use and its free but i cant create any new projects anymore because of my phone storage i reinstalled the app multiple times , delete stuff i dont need , upgraded my storage , restart my phone and its still full i even offload the app multiple times and it doesn't work otherwise its a great app hopefully i can create projects again one day"
It is literally completely free and there is thousands of stuff you can use in the app that is free there zero paying their zero premium there’s literally nothing that is money in the app which I’m crazed I thought that there was no editing app like this but there is my mind is in an upside dimension with for mine blowing pieces of chicken nuggets
"I think CapCut is a great app and it’s very good for editing videos and especially music videos. However, for artists like me I think there should more cool and trending FX. For one, I think a trail effect would be nice, a clone trail not just light or echo. Two, a clone effect would be nice. Three, more body effects and not just fx that go around your body. And four, more interesting, trippy, and fun transitions."
Ok don’t get me wrong I love the app but for the past hour I’ve been trying to get into it and it’s no longer working everything else in my phone is working but the app it’s self is frozen and won’t let me touch anything and I have an edit there that took me hours that I’m still trying to finish I’m literally almost done but it’s not working and I’m gonna freaking cry Bc I’m gonna fail school if I don’t get this done and I’m not trying to start it over cuz I have a life and it took over 3 hours
"I love this app and imo it’s the best video editor out there, especially for the price. However, the last few days I haven’t been able to add any effects, animations, or text because there’s “no internet connection” the app says. I’ve tried multiple devices which all have internet and no luck. Apparently I’m not the only one having this issue after checking the AppStore’s reviews. Hoping you will have it fixed soon."
"I’m not one to review apps, but I can’t help with this one. First of all, it’s 100% free, which is awesome. Second, one of the most easy editing apps to use. It’s extremely user friendly. There are so many features that I can’t even comprehend it. Great for starters or people who just want to make a quick edit. Absolutely perfect."
I really like this app I got to learn how to edit and so much more but the main problem I had was when I added a audio it would glitch a lot and some times log me out of the app I got really annoyed from that happening and then my Storage was getting full because of the app and so I deleted it cuz of the storage but it was a good app 😀
I love CapCut sooo much it’s an amazing editing app and I love that it’s free and you can remove CapCut at the ending but I have one problem before I could reverse my videos and now I can’t is this happening for anyone else or is it just me…I just want that to be fixed but other than that CapCut is and amazing editing app and I recommend it.
"So first, Capcut is super easy to use I made a bunch of edits and videos that are too good to be true to be made by my age tbh! Its super easy doesnt really have innapropiate stuff too!
Gosh you can import it too it is so easy! I love capcut! I use it for all my editing too! I have became an awesome editor just by using capcut no tutorials needed either!"
App is amazing but it would be crazy if y’all introduced away to bring after effects presets into the app and make our own presets so we can add all the effects with one button it would make it so much efficient and add 3D text and let us bring custom fonts into the app thanks
"Capcut is a very good app, but I am VERY concerned. I’ve realized yesterday, at the bottom of your edited video, it may have something like “11M”. One of my videos got 744M and I’m QUITE SCARED that means 744 MILLION. If so, how could you block it? I post my face and cringy things which I don’t want anyone seeing. I think the M means million, because yesterday it was 730M-735M. I’m really really scared. Please give me and answer!"
I’m very happy about what you did but when I needed to used the graphics it didn’t work how I wanted to work and can you please fix it because I’m trying to do a edit but it didn’t work with graphics and that it keeps going back to the size when I put the picture in so can you please fix it
"Hello! I’ve been using this app for some time now, and it works amazingly! It works well with quality, and I love the shading filters! But whenever I want to listen to music while editing (I use a iPhone/iPad) the app pauses my music. I’m not sure if I’m being stupid, and it’s a feature in the settings I can just turn off, but if it isn’t please fix this. Thank you!"
"the app is so good, it’s literally so easy compared to other editing apps, however my storage is crazy but that’s cause of me, CapCut should add accounts so all the edits get saved to your account and you can delete the app and re install it and the account would still have your edits!"
First of all this app is ok to use but it crashes its honestly really annoying and I really don’t recommend it if it’s gonna keep doing this I’m really annoyed right now because I was trying to edit a video and it said I had no photos but my camera roll is stocked so idk what’s going on but I will tell every single person I know to uninstall or don’t install this app if u don’t fix it and I will spread it around my school and TikTok so if u keep this up I’m coming for you.
"Cap Cut is a great app but when it comes to storage it acts up, for example today I was logging in and about to make an edit when I tried to tap on the creat new project it said I needed more storage when I had lots of space left , but I did as they said and tried to clean up my storage I deleted a lot of pictures and videos but it still would not let me make a new project☹️☹️."
"I really like this app! I’m a beginner but I was able to make decent edits through this app. I use this app for all of my content. I just have one question, if I were to transfer my SIM card to another phone, will all my edits be lost?"
"I love this app and a lot of other people do to but there’s one thing I think you should add. In effects you should add a slide bar to adjust how much the effect is showing if that makes sense for example, I don’t really like how much glow edge glow uses so there could like be a slide bar like the filters to adujust how much it uses. I hope this made sense other than that AMAZING APP"
"The main reason I got this is because I wanted to make gacha club shorts and also I wanted to make my cat have lips and talk 😂 but whenever I got it , I was addicted!! I was making edit after edit, tik tok after tik tok! It was amazing!! I extremely encourage everyone to check this app out because it is literally the best app on my whole phone! 👏"
The app is amazing it helps me to make Gacha life videos now because of it I have 5k without I would’ve only have 1k but still I would still be thank for I have 1k but cap cut I am about to have 6k if you have not downloaded it you have to it’s the amazing you guys just have to download it can make more then just Gacha life videos
this app is so good for editing but I would like too maybe add more animations at once because I want to make a bit more combos for my edits and it gets a bit frustrating when I have to keep saving and making more projects so I can put more animations so that’s a idea for any new updates that id really enjoy. Overall 4 and a half stars!
First of all it’s so easy just to move stuff and second it’s so easy just to put effects or make it look third a lot of gacha tubers that are sufesel use this give this five star rating you won’t regret it there’s one thing is I can’t turn my pics into animation but everyone else can but still very good editing app
"I made some pretty good clips with this app! This would be a 5/5 for me, if there wasn’t so much glitch. After I made up to about three projects, the app just started to glitch and lag whenever I tried to edit something or add an effect. Even if I wanted to look at my precious projects it would glitch! If you could fix this issue, that would be amazing! ☺️☺️"
So I downloaded this app and I have had for a while and it worked. But then all of a sudden it just stopped working. Every time there was a split in between each clip it would lag a little. Then when I have WiFi and I try to put a transition it says I’m offline or no internet connection. Here is the worst part when I export my video it legit would cut off the rest of the whole vid and give like what 8 seconds of the vid. Please fix it’s really annoying.
Overall great app for editing and I love it really but I have been having some trouble lately because when I try to use options I haven’t used yet it’s saying I don’t have any internet connection even whenever I do so that’s just something that I’ve been having a problem with for the past couple of months
CapCut helpppp I thinks there’s something wrong with my CapCut okay so normally when I make my edits I use the auto velocity option which is in style. But yesterday when I went to go look for it I couldn’t find it and like the option for the auto velocity is just gone for me so if someone could help me or idk 😭
I was desperate to finish a project for school and I tried multiple websites and apps that would make my video vertical but it just wasn’t happening that’s when I decided to download this app and it literally took me  5 minutes to do this video no kidding I love this app because it just saved my grade again love this app
"I’ve been using capcut for most of my edits and it was pretty good. Better than kinemaster. There is a lot of glitches in the app though, Please fix them. But other than that, The editing software is pretty good/decent but I’ve switched over to Alight Motion recently but I will still frequently make edits on capcut because its still a good editing app."
"Okay, so I LOVE THIS APP!! IT’S SO MUCH FUN RO EDIT AND MAKE ALL THESE COOL VIDEOS!! but there’s just one thing…
When I select some photos for the video, (I like to make gacha life
Videos) everything is okay, but when I make more photos for me to add it says I have NO PHOTOS. it would really but great if it didn’t do that :l i love this app so much but they really need to fix that.
I hope you don’t have to do this same thing with capcut!!"
I love how easy it is to make awesome videos out of any media you have on your phone. Up until recently the app has worked fantastic. As of late when I go to add sounds from my linked tiktok account the app refuses to connect and allow me to use sounds. I have to delete the app and re-install to sync my audios. Other than that I have no complaints.
"It is a very good app for starter and advanced editors. I use it everyday for simple things like making mini movies and things like that. A tutorial for simple edits would be nice or maybe an update where we can use multiple animations without having to make a new project. Other than that, it’s a very good app"
It’s like a good editing app which is really good because I’ve been looking for a editing app that could help me like edits and cap cut was my first option I was really getting really bad but I keep moving on I wanted to quit but I didn’t thank you for Cap cut this is really great I like your app that’s why I give it a five star Reading
First of all I love this app. I have heard so many good views about it and I just had to try it out and it’s so easy to work and use. The best thing about it is that it’s free and it’s amazing! You can make as many videos as you want and they turned out to be really good quality. I just love this app so much and it’s just amazing!!
"its a bit complicated and probably wont suit a starter to editing pics, videos, and so on. I started off with KineMaster and that was a easy way to edit. Now I use this app and its super great and more options than KineMaster. Overall, I would reckon this app if you have patience to understand and learn."
The apps good and all but there are somethings that are very annoying the app is not the best there’s this thing that’s very annoying and it’s when I wanna make a edit but it says storage FULL😡 it’s so annoying i delete all my edits and it still says storage Full I hate it so much and I deleted all my pictures and saved one video to make this so CapCut can you please fix this and I’d say this app is a 3 stars sorry
"I love this app! It’s free, and very good for making edits! The sounds are very good and the animations are beyond amazing! Bu5 I do have a suggestion, maybe you guys could add more text to speech voices because for my edits I like to use tech t9 speech but there is like no voices at all to use, there is only 2 girl voices and 1 boy voice. So, please add more voices!"
"Hello! I love this app so much!!! It’s super easy and it’s free which makes it even better!!! If you want to make edits like the youtubers, I recommend this app. It’s an all in one app that lets you do things from add effects to make your own audio! The people who left bad reviews are karens and five year olds. Download this app today!!!"
"This app is really good for editing! However, there’s one problem that keeps occurring to me over and over again. Whenever I try to put an animation on one of the stickers, it works for a small amount of time but it stops the animation as soon as I exit out of the menu (despite it still having the line to show that the animation is still there). Can you please fix this?"
"Dude i use this app 24/7, like, everyday! Its so amazing and i love everything about it, its so underrated. And the fact that its so good without needing to be payed for is even better!! Hardly any of the things need to be payed for, and what i do doesnt need to be payed for, i love this app so much and its my favorite, ditch the KineMaster and the PowerDirector apps. Get this one now instead!!"
"This is an amazing editing app, and probably the best for mobile. It has amazing transitions, no watermark, it’s everything a mobile editor can ask for. But for me can you please just remove the limit of only having 6 overlays? Or if not just make it a larger number?"
"I love this app a lot and I like animating with it. But, Sometimes when I’m animating there are different parts for the body, And when it happens I need more then 6 layers. Yes, There are 6 layers which are a lot! I use this app for editing. I give the app a 5 star review, It’s just the over lays.

At least about 10 over lays will do."
It’s super easy to use and I make really good videos with it you can even remove the made with CapCut ending and it’s more simple than KineMaster but when I have WiFi it says when I try to put an animation it says I have no internet please fix this other than that this is a great app i recommended highly
"The app is amazing! It is a great alternative to other apps like KineMaster. Besides that, my only issue is that it take A TON of storage. It’s been doing something where it download a good 10 megabytes whenever I want to open a SINGLE project. My phone barely has any storage at all, and I really think there should be a way to manage how much the app is taking up."
So I’m a survivor host and I make edits for vote offs and I’ve tried so many apps for effects and I finally found this one! It is all you need!!! Over a thousand effects and sounds are free and they never ask you to pay for anything. I didn’t know it was possibly for it to be this good but it is! Thank you so much to the creators of it.
"I downloaded other apps that started to glitch and just became a black screen. But this doesn't glitch at all and it would be perfect for my videos!🥳👍🏼 But I would want it to update, for example just like put in actual music made by celebrities, that would be Better!👍🏼🤗"
I love this app but it does not really take a lot of storage for example I delete all my photos and it still says full and I’m like why will you not work and also forces me to delete the on CapCut I work so hard for and I have to delete it but overall it’s a good edit app everything on the app is very good and everything is free and no water mark
CapCut is a very good free editing software but one of my complaints is sometimes it doesn’t let import anything and I would haft to wait 2-4 hours just be able to edit something and that’s very annoying so I hope you guys fix that! Other than that CapCut is one of the editing softwares out there!
Sad to say but there is a glitch where it says your storage is full when it’s not. So anytime you close out or try to save the video to your iCloud. It will not let you save or get back in. Fix this because many others have experienced the same thing.
The app sometimes dose not work and I have to close out and restart the app. A ok app really easy to learn but sometimes it gives me some trouble. A couple days ago it started asking me for something I went it and let it have access to everything but it is still not working. but like I said a overall good app.
"Ay y’all, keep it low. Not tryna have to much competition lol. That’s how good this app is being the best free editing tool out there right now. I’ve tried a bunch already and this is the best by far. Even the free version of well known editing tools can’t compare. Honestly they’re scamming you with this app being out. Please keep it low 😂"
"I love this app but I have a idea that will make the app better, I feel like you should add a favorite button to a transition so you don’t have to keep on scrolling back and forth and instead be able to have a option to find it right away. I hope you get to see this."
If I could I would put 4.5 stars because u can’t put an account so once you delete the app u lose everything. Also it sometimes freezes and idk if that is my phone or not. I do wish there were more cool stuff (not just basic) but I love this app and made many edits
When I’m working on a video and I exit out and come back the video goes blank. And loses all the hard word I have done. I was making a video for the whole day today and it just went blank when I got back to it. I hate that all my hard work on making a video just pooped like that. And I can’t even get it back. This hasn’t just happened to me once. It happens to me ever single time I use CapCut. I thought it was just my internet so I went over to my friends house but it still did it. CapCut you need to fix that ASAP.
"It’s a great app and has made me a better editor in only a few weeks. But it’s so annoying cause (this happens frequently) I was trying to do the wave 3 animation for an edit, and I kept putting it to fast, but whenever I pressed the check botton and watched it, it was going fast and kept replaying! I was literally trying to fix it just now and I’m about to delete the app. Capcut pls fix this"
"I love this app no doubt, but it takes up way to much data like a lot.I can’t even delete the app cause all the data would be..so if you could add a mode were you can (optional) your email to log in and see your saved edits.
Thank you for taking your time reading this.
☺️❤️"
I love the app and I use it a lot but there is one bug I’ve noticed which gets extremely frustrating. I connected my tiktok sounds to it but after I close the app I have to uninstall it then install it back to reconnect my tiktok account. It’s very annoying to do. Other than that the app is great to me. Just would like the bug fixed.
"I use capcut alot and i love it! Its so useful for editing clips! Capcut is a really good editing app! ✨🤗 The only thing yhat i really want is if you can add a like feature where you can freeze the video for a second like funimate does, if you can do that. That would be amazing! 🤗 thank you capcut for your amazing editing service ❤️"
"I love this app and have used it for almost a year and was super excited when graphs were added! I’m amazed that all of this is 100% free to use! However, there is one problem: slow-mos. I’ve seen velocity edits on vsco and videostar and they turned out gorgeous whereas CapCut makes it look really choppy. No hate, but PLEASE  PLEASE add a way to make slow mos smoother and not go frame by frame. Thanks!✨❤️"
CapCut is amazing. I’ve used it for a while now and I can confidently say it’s gotta be one of the best video editors out there. There’s so many options for what you want to do with your video and it’s so easy to use. The interface doesn’t take that long to get used to either.
i love this app. i use it for my edits and it’s the best app for it. other apps make u pay for most of the different effects and everything but capcut gives you so much to work with for free! 10/10 recommend <3 i love that they add more effects and transitions as well! i’m always excited for what will come out.
"Hi, so I tried using Capcut for my videos and I think it’s really good. It has a lot of great effects…could work on the Chroma Key and Background Remove features a bit…and I think it’s okay. But is it okay if you can improve the quality of the videos? The videos I export and save always end up blurry and I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. Much thanks!"
"an amAZING app, even though im a little confused with it, if your looking for something nice and simple this is the one. I have been using this app for a year and i approve of it. I havent used too much editing apps before, so i hope if you get this you enjoy it

From- Someone you will never know 😋"
"Hello! THIS APP IS LIKE THE BEST!!! Really I use this app all the time! But the problem is I can’t use it anymore because my storage is full, I wanted to get it on my laptop/computer and there’s a website to get it but that might give me a virus, so can you please add capcut to MacBook air AppStore and every other device? Thank you! I really appreciate it. This app is the best! Continue adding more cool features"
"Please please please help.  This app is my favorite and the audio gltich is absolutely killing me right now.  Iv tried everything. Uninstalling and reinstalling and updating my phone (iphone 12pro) please help. I love this app to much to use anything else, but there is nothing else"
"I think capcut is such ana amazing app. My one ggestion is to have motion blur with a key frame, for example, if you use a key frame to go left to right, it would have a blurred motion while going left to right. This would make things a lot easier and even better in my opinion!"
"I suggest you make more well effects such as ghost effect, velocity, and more.
also put a like amount thing so if you want to use the effect once or multiple you get to choose, other than that this is a great editing app!!:)"
"Everything about the app is great! I use it to make edits all the time. The only thing is i just wish it had a place where you could retrieve deleted edits. I slipped up and deleted a few on accident, one of which took me DAYS to complete. Other than that the app is wonderful!"
Man it’s amazing I use this app a lot because it’s easier to use than other apps and it features more definitely 5 stars you should download this app it’s completely free to and it’s very easy to figure out so go download it if not then it’s cool have fun paying a lot of money for scams cause this app is the opposite of a scam
"Capcut is a really good app and I’ve been making TTSEGC with it and my channel has been growing! It has all I need! But, there’s one problem. I just updated my storage to 200 and it says I don’t have enough storage. I deleted and reinstalled it 3 times and it didn’t work. If you fix  this, five stars are coming your way!
Thanks for reading."
"I have tiktok and I always make videos of roblox and I was looking for an app and then I stumbled apon CapCut. CapCut is a very useful app, and I love it a lot! I feel like it could use a little bit more features though. When I do overlays for the video and press remove backround, it barely shows the video. That could use some changes, but overall CapCut is amazing!"
A great app I use it everyday I love how much work you guys put into this instead of these other guys it stands out the most that what makes it the best in my book only thing I want in this app is a floating emoji intro that would be so cool so you can place it as the canvas behind a video that would be really cool🤙🏽💕
"I have used multiple video editors in my time, as a person who also posts them, I've seen the best quality and most people liking capcut edits. No watermark for FREE the transitions are GOOD you can extract audios from recordings and screen recordings and I LOVE it! I recommend this app 100% with custom slo-mo speed up,and the other things I named, Capcut is amazing!"
"this a really good app in my opinion honestly i’m pretty new to editing and this was really easy i already made 3 edits and my freinds are giving them a good 9-10.

i’m not like a “pro” so there might be flaws but for now i would say “good job 👍🏼😊”. but there is one concern it would be really cool if there was a feature were we could share our edits in the app this would probably help other people gain ideas also it would be nice if there was a way could “apply “ dark mode because some people just like the appealing of having dark mode on for instance me.

any ways good job and have a great day/night ⭐️🤍✨"
"Hi , I’m here to ask why did you guys take the  style button away where you can find the velocity effect? I’m just here to say can you please put that back on it’s hard to do regular velocity when you guys just made a simple tool for it but everything else is great I’m just disappointed."
this app is amazing! Better than any other editing apps! I really love it! Its the only app i use for editing. Theres actually nothing wrong right now. Its really useful! I just havent been using it for months because i just get really bored and lazy. But still its amazing but i think i might get back into it! But nice work on this!
So when I try to do a sound with the beat feature I noticed that when you press it to fast it deletes the beat and it was annoying and maybe I was asking if you can move the delete button somewhere else like make the delete button have it own button not with the “make new beat” thing please I want you guys to make please do it because it messes up my video with the sound I beg you
Can y’all ad overlay effects cause I want to use effects but only on my overlay pictures cause normal overlay doesn’t go on effects I seem to have the newest update but how come I don’t have shake 2 cause I seen another editor who uses this app use is but I can’t find it
"The app is great!! But for some reason, when I try to add an overlay, use effects, use filters, it just won’t work for me. I could add transitions and other things but these I really need for videos and editing. Please fix this when you can. Thank you!"
"This app is incredible, but when I make edits and I export them to my camera roll, the video is not the same. It does the beginning of the video but then after like 5 seconds it just freezes for the rest of the video. If you can fix the bug that will be great!!!"
"Love this app, I saw an add about it on TikTok, and I needed a new editing app so I downloaded it and it was actually really good. Usually every editing app you need to buy something to get all the cool accessories and stuff but this for free is LEGENDARY and I made some epic montages on it and it looks really nice. Super easy btw would recommend downloading."
"So i used to love using this app and i got really great at it, but recently i havent been able to load anything on there. It keeps saying “no internet connection” and its getting frustrating. Ive tried everything and it never works. I dont know if its my phone or the app, but please see if you can fix it!!"
So fun and easy to use. I’m very new to editing and this helped me a lot with starting off. There are some minor bugs but that’s not really an issue. The only thing that I don’t like is that I cant listen to music while I edit if there was a way for you to fix that please? Thank you!
Every time I make a smooth velocity on capcut it comes out weird. It doesn’t go through smoothly as it should. I exited out and go back in and it’s the same thing. I even export it and it still comes out glitchy. This has recently started and I don’t know why because it never did this until now
This app has been doing great you have added so many new features that help like smooth slowmo and graphs this app is great for beginners but some editors might want more from this app so you could ad motion blur this really helpful for some editors that want more from this app!
"FYI, I HAVE BEEN EDITING FOR SIX YEARSS!! I have never seen a worse app for editing like this one. Firstly, The chroma key option is broken and you are basically unable to do anything with most of the applications on here as they crash. Majority of the time the app crashed unexpectedly or I have to delete 1,000+ photos for it to work. The amount of space a single edit takes up is outrageous. Use funimate instead, it’s much better and you can actually get stuff done. I’m very dissatisfied. 

           - a sad and sour editor"
Okay so I have downloaded many… I mean many Editing apps and I found the right 1 it’s basic it’s easy but you guys should reconsider adding more tik tok songs for those who don’t have tik tik it’s no cr tho other apps make you buy songs for money this 1 gives you a few songs but add songs like Good 4 U or Blinding Lights or Face Off or u know?
So I love cat cat but there’s one problem about it there is one button that doesn’t work in the whole app and its style I’ll try to do some things on cap cut but it says it doesn’t work but I only need one and it’s the 3-D edit right next to the big head so can you please enable that thank you🤘you rock
So basically mine wasn’t working so I tried to delete it and re-download it but when I did it started loading so I waited about 5 min and nothing happened so I closed it checked an hour later still was loading the next day I checked it was still loading this is the 3rd day of me trying so if you can do something about please help me because I love this app.
"It is a fantastic app. And the best part is that it is free. There are a few suggestions that would make this app greater.

1. There are bunch of effects but we can’t use masks on them. We cannot put blur/rgb effects on specific part on the video.  
2. We cannot use mask on texts which would be a great inclusion."
My friend Told me about this app it is amazing I love editing pictures into one big edit the shortcut the function is my favorite function in the app but if you want to become a content creator I would not recommend this for editing your videos because I've tried and it's not my best so I just recommend to do an edit small edits and not very big edits.
So I am a editor for some stuff and I love using this app because at first it was a bit difficult but I ended up figuring it out but I do have a suggestion do you think you can make the quality a bit better if not that’s totally fine 🤩.
I love this app! And I am very picky about editing apps.  I have tried so many apps that work great at first but then stop working. CapCut was not like that. I have been using it for a while now and absolutely love it still. Also it is completely free. You need to download this. You will not be disappointed.
"CapCut is a very Great App! I used it and started the blow up a bit- Mot a lot but I was thankful, I feel like it could use more updates, not like it’s laggy if that there’s bugs- But in transitions and things to edit to your videos- ( If they did update and add new transitions then sorry because I haven’t noticed yet 😅👌)"
"I downloaded this like 2 months ago. Its all free. But the one dumb thing is that since I make edits all the time I’ve had to redownload it twice cause it would always say that I need more storage in camera I delete stuff. Still says this same thing
Please update that if you can!"
"You don’t have to pay for anything as far as I know, and you can even delete the water mark at the end. And if you don’t want to you dorm have to have a watermark smack in the middle of the screen! I would definitely recommend it if your just getting into editing like me!"
I absolutely love this app! I downloaded it today and have no complaints. It’s so user friendly and everything makes sense. I didn’t get frustrated like I have on so many editing apps before. This one just works. Thank you so such a wonderful video editing app!
"I’ve been using Capcut for a while now, my only complaint is when it says “no space on phone” or something like that, I get that I have no space on my phone but it doesn’t mean I shouldn’t be allowed to not make more videos! I should still be able to make videos but not be able to download them!!"
"I love LOVEEEE CapCut, and I stand by it as my main video editor. I love it so much that I only really have one small bug about it. I wish the app had a feature to import custom fonts for the text option. If that were implemented, I wouldn’t have to switch between 3 or 4 different editing apps. It’s a small complaint, but would make things 10x easier."
"This is a great editing app but every time I tap on the app button it logg’s me out. It is not connection problems, because it says I have full connection.  Since that happens I can not make my edits anymore, so if you have any suggestions on how to fix it pls tell me. Thanks!!!"
"I use it a lot for my editing, and its really good but a few problems I think should be resolved:

1. Whenever the app closes or anything the project is already saved but the green screen and audio moves further on the video and it messes me up.

2. The remove background feature stopped working for me and just removed me instead."
"It’s a great app and I use it for all my videos! But whenever my storage is too full, it’ll give me the notification which is understandable! And I go to my photos to delete it and clear up space to save the video. But in doing so it deletes the video I was  just working on. And it gets really annoying. Overall great app and thank you!"
"So I’ve tried like video star, i think it’s called? Oml I can’t figure out what to do. There is so much things on it and no tutorial. Then I tried capcut. There isn’t a tutorial but I figured it out really quickly. It’s well organized and you don’t need to pay for anything better. I RECOMMEND FOR ANY EDITORS"
"Overall it’s a really good app, the only problem I has is that when the app updated all of the text on my edits stoped working and it make me “install update” or something like that every time I opened an draft that I made before the update. Otherwise all the app functions well for my uses and is fairly simple to use and figure out."
I love this app but sometimes when I leave the app while I’m still editing I will come back and try to press anywhere on CapCut but everywhere freezes on my screen and I’m not able to do anything but I’m able to press anywhere out of the app. Is kid it’s just me that this happens too but if u can plz try and fix it ty
I love this app. It is great for any use. There is one problem though. Whenever I use my music in the videos it stutters and sometimes go silent. But when I upload it the music is perfectly fine. Setting that aside this is a great app and would totally recommend.
"Ok, this app is why I’ve been doing editing. All the features are free and no watermark, unlike apps where you have to pay 14 dollars just to remove a small logo. I love all the transition features and possibilities. And you can change the text on the ending. Added bonus. Wonderful app 😊"
"Love CapCut, but.. when I was editing it changed to a whole different language for the effects like some of it was English and most of it was a whole different language. Then I was going to write this review then saw update, now effects are back to normal but like why did it do that??"
I’ll make this short and simple it’s an amazing app  transitions great layers but the one thing that makes it terrible is that I have a bunch of photos that I use but when I go to use them they say I have no photos so I go to a new project then go back to the one I was working on and then it still won’t work so I have delete the app just for it to work again and the quality could be better.
"this app is honestly awesome and i’m loving it it’s just one thing. the importing of videos. i will click one or multiple videos and when i click add it says “couldn’t import” even if i close and reopen the app. please please fix this and if you do this will be the best editing app but other than that this is awesome, but please fix this major issue"
Trust me I love this app it really helped make my videos better but you can do things to make this app legendary. Like adding a Pro mode with a more professional format and looking at computer editors so that you can add things to make this app better. Also you can add ar and vfx in the pro mode and add an overlay option that locks it to the clip that you’re on. So great already but it could be legendary. (Look at Adobe premiere pro)
"So, I was and am a middle class in editing. Over all it’s an awesome app for editing but when I’m trying to edit, I clicked all the photos I want to use but when I press import it say try again. This happens almost every time I want to make an edit. If you could fix this issue, I would be delighted."
"Many editors have a sorta reflective ground, kinda giving off a reflection, like they are standing on water. It’s called shaders. It makes their videos look 1000 times greater and more edited. But the tutorials are a lot of work, and I’m giving a big thumbs up to you guys about the Auto Velocity style. That is 1000x more easier. So keep up the good work. ⚠️THIS WAS NOT TO CRITICIZE ANYONE⚠️ ❤️"
"I have internet, I love this app but lately it hasn’t been working AT ALL. I’m in internet and it says I’m not, I have to redownload all my work and a lot of it won’t download so I can’t even access it. I’m a blooming YouTuber and this is extremely problematic. Could you PLEASE fix this? It’s annoying and I love this app but my experience has been going down hill for a while now and nothing I do to fix it works"
"hi, CapCut. i have some filter suggestions. The filters on this are absolutely amazing. and the camera thats on it is so smooth and awesome! But heres the part, i think there should be more filters for us. like snapchat, and some more fun filters. thanks for reading!! 💖"
This app is amazing for editing and making it super easy to to do everything but the only thing that bothers me so much is that it wont let me use my Saved Tik Tok sounds for some reason I don't know if it just me but i uninstalled twice and still the same thing and for that i rate it 4/5. But if anybody has any suggestions please help !
So I only made 2 videos so far with this cause I loved the idea that I can transfer my TikTok sounds over and make the edits. Unfortunately for both times I had to delete the app and download it just to make the video. It doesn’t add all audios and after I finish one edit it will just say “can’t connect to internet try again” and no matter which WiFi I use or my data it never loads unless I delete the app and redownload it. I’ll just stick with my last editing app until this is resolved
"hey. this app has been a good app that has helped me edit. i actually don’t use capcut for editing instead, i use it for watermarks, overlays, etc. this app is a very good app for starters and helped me on my earlier editing days. i don’t know what’s wrong with my capcut, but i haven’t been able to find the clean slow-mo feature. i’ve re-downloaded the app and still haven’t seen it. most my friends who edit have this feature so i don’t know what’s wrong with my app. please help!! other than that i really recommend this app for new editors or editors who just want to have fun."
Hello capcut you should really add a pinch effect and you should add where to you can put where you can layer 2-3 animations on a clip it would really help then exporting or if you can’t could you maybe add an pinch animation in the middle of the screen just like spin out but no spin pls and thank you for your time W editing app btw
"I love the app, I have no problem with it but I wish there was an option to turn on dark theme on the main page where your edited videos are. if you can please add an option to turn on dark theme, that would be great.
But other than that it’s a really good app, I recommend it.
Keep going a good job.👍"
"I use CapCut around the clock as a editor, but I’ve had a few bugs. It’s easy to use, but I’d like to know why won’t it let me download!? No it’s not due to my storage, because I’ve already downloaded it before, then deleted it. So as I download it again, it simply loads, and then does’t do anything. I’m wondering if there has been other reviews saying this, if there are please fix the bug. Overall, it’s a good app.
-A random 8 year old editor"
"So I loveeeee this app it’s great for YouTubers 
But it has some bugs and lacks some good transitions and it would be amazing if it was collaborative so that your friends could edit with you live but overall a great easy to use app one more thing I would add pro color grading and better music"
This is an amazing editing app but there is something that you should add its basically adding animation to a photo you have many effects like the 3d zoom for example its kinda like that but if the picture is moving and i have to add a separate app to do animate the photo
"i appreciate this app very much. i am a member of many communities and making small 30 second edits of them only takes 15 minutes once you get the hang of it

when you export the video when you’re finished, it has an automatic feature where you can choose to post your video to tiktok, instagram, etc. it also has no watermark! i’ve downloaded so many apps which removed the watermark but at a cost. this is amazing.

it also has a feature called “shortcut” where it makes an edit out of 15 images or less. animated transitions and audio is all done for you! (the shortcut feature has a watermark, unless you upload it to tiktok)

it also allows you to extract audio from videos for free. 

the only thing i dislike about this app is that you can’t import audio files from your files on your device. i think it would be an amazing feature to add. 

overall, it’s one of the best editing apps on mobile and i would definitely recommend it to beginners and experts at editing!

4/5 stars :)"
"This app is great, there are so many things you could do when editing videos on this app. The only problem is that if you trim at playhead so many times in the same place of a/the part of the video(s), the app starts to lag and you can’t see the progress you made in your editing when playing the video(s)."
"All in all, CapCut is a great app. But there are some things missing that really need improvement.

          When you try to make a video slow motion, it makes it glitchy instead of smooth. Which bothers me, personally. And if I make a clip that’s about 0.1 seconds, it won’t let me make it longer or delete it."
I really like this app but when I try and edit it sometimes glitches and pauses my edit I tried saving it and it won’t work and I have to redownload the app but I don’t want to loose my progress even tho I only started this app just yesterday but overall this app is really good lt has amazing effects and it’s really easy to use and I really like it
"I’m in love with this editing app, most apps i’ve downloaded to edit they’ve always made me pay for extras. This has good quality can be a bit laggy. Great filters & Stickers. It’s good at slowing things down or making things faster. The animations are amazing. Etc. Either all I love this app 10/10. :)"
I think cap cut is amazing really easy to I spent all day making an edit but now it’s telling me I have storage issues so the made me mad cause I have a tablet anyways so I sent all the pic to my phone and deleted everything in both my phone and tablet but it still says I have to clean my storage and won’t even let me look at my edits I would rally appreciate it if that would not happen
"The app lets you do fun cool edits you can do edits of people like yourself ,friends and celebs the app is very easy to use I found out about it by tiktok same as funimate but really I’m not gonna pay money to make edits CapCut is the best edit app I ever used and ever will use this app definitely deserves a 5 star rating and no need for fixing ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
"I absolutely love this app! 
All it’s transitions and kinks and it’s quirks! 
But one problem stands out to me, which is that the audio or music on my videos seems to crash when I add even one sparkle effect, which causes problems along the way with the entire sight crashing within itself. 
Overall, no other complaints, so if you’re reading this questioning if you should get the app, then yes. I highly recommend it.
I just don’t know if the team or whoever can fix this issue if other people are having it, like I said I don’t know. 
Thank you and have a good life."
"I recommend CapCut. 
CapCut is very easy to use and many good effects. As a GachaTuber, I love this app and make all my edits and videos with it. It’s also very good for beginners. 
I would like to be able to organize my projects though. I want to be able to put them in groups like my Gacha videos, edits, and music stuff."
This is an amazing app 10 out of 10 but it could use a little more improvement. When there is the three dots next to your project and you press them I would recommend a save to photos option to get the project in your library.
"This app is so good!! I have tested a lot of editing apps and none compare to this, no watermark, amazing stuff to edit with and very easy to use 10/10 would recommend to everyone of my friends my channel is NayBlox if u wanna see a example I will have a video up soon Roblox V.S Real life and I am using cap cut for it"
This is my first ever review and as and video artist this app is AMAZING. The amount of edits you have in this app is amazing andddd ITS FREE YES FREE. A lot of photo editing apps require you to pay and who likes doing that. Beside from that matter it is really well made and the effects are my favorite parts now I can make the logo images I always wanna make!
"Tbh I just downloaded this app because my friend showed me and It’s so good of an app! :D There’s no bugs what so ever and it’s great to make lots of edits and fun videos! 
I really enjoy this app even tho I only done had it for a day- but from the very first video I made it works really well. And you should mostly get it too trust me you will be happy UwU"
"okay so CapCut is a GREAT app! I love using it for ALL my edits and it’s just amazing, it I rated it 5 stars because for these past few days, whether I’m using data or my Wi-Fi is good, it will say “no internet connection” on certain things and stuff, I’ve restarted my phone, tried to update the app, and have deleted and reinstalled the app but it is T working. pleaseeee fix this!"
It good app but sometimes when I edit I add effects but whenever I expose it it made my screen froze and whenever I deleted the app it still do the same thing and when I deleted again with no effect it still work? But when I put effcet again it just but it froze...?
I love this app it’s the best app I have ever used but when I was using it I wanted to add effects and stuff but when I clicked on one it said “ no internet connection connect to internet and try again “ but I know for a fact that I am connected to my internet and I don’t know what to do.
"I’ve been using capcut for like a month and it’s a really good app, but the one thing i really hate is the no internet problem and i keep getting it even though i have really good wifi, i would love it if you could fix this (this would also help me not struggle on this app🥲)  thank you 😊"
Capcup is my number 1 favorite editing app but ever since the last update it’s lagging and bugging. Whenever I add an effect it doesn’t show on the timeline but it’s there. Also some playback bugs. Note that I’ve always been using in on my ipad pro. I love this app and I highly recommend everyone to use it since it’s easy and also you get the best quality. I will give 5 stars once it’s fixed. Thank you for such a amazing editing app.
I would appreciate if you guys could direct me to where I can find it?:) I love to use it for my photos across my social media platforms which also helps me earn money. I’m willing to pay for a membership with the high quality value this app produces!:)
"Short and sweet, I was looking for a free video editor, and I saw CapCut, downloaded it, and have been using it for months, it’s got all the features that editing softwares that you have to pay for have, and it’s simple and easy to use, 10/10 would recommend!"
Whenever I leave CapCut for a few days and come back and try to add an audio from tiktok in my favs it always says “My internet connection is bad” or something like that and it wont work until I take the app off and dowload it again I don’t know why it’s like that and I usually always have my wifi on? And it’s good it’s just CapCut…
"It’s amazing and I totally recommend, I would love to give it a 5 star but I just have one concern and that’s it. It’s the slow-mo. I know this editing app shouldn’t be for like montages or anything but it’s just the slow-mo isn’t smooth. An example could be like VSCO how the slow mo is like tracking the motion, but CapCut seems to do it frame by frame so I struggle with velocity edits"
"I like this app it’s really good for editing if you know how to use it but for some reason when I use the graphs it goes out to show the whole picture when I zoomed in, it used to show the effect with the picture still zoomed in but now it just zooms out and I don’t like it. Maybe it’s a bug with me but I need help it’s annoying having to re zoom in because it keeps zooming out."
Ok so this app is amazing you can add backgrounds and stuff like that it’s just that why is the background blurry like I mean really😒 its blurry and you can’t see it well so that’s the only problem also plsssss allow have more overlays like I would like to there not be just one overlay also plsss allow more songs like the songs are just tik tok songs and like just allow more songs pls.
"I’m trying to make a Fnaf Gacha security breach edit thing and Its not loading when I do the shortest I can do for “Animation.” I’m making my AU’s Rotate and its not working for multiple and I went back to other ones and it works for some reason! I Dont know why its doing that, it might be that I need to update it, but I don't know."
So I love the app 💕 But it’s sometimes kinda laggy and it’s pretty hard to edit pretty hard 😢 So I would recommend you could 1.add some more animations especially in out. 2. Like maybe some more filters I mean maybe y’all can come up with something? 3. It’s great but about the glitching part I’ve seen that like hackers or sum PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUE!But otherwise it’s amazing 🤩!<3
I fell in love with this app but there’s is one major issue. Today when I went one to watch a video I made they were all gone! All of my hardwork is gone. I spent a long time making these videos and now I am very disappointed. I expected my videos to be on there every time I go on the app. Can the developer please fix this issue?
"Occasionally when I’m trying to export a video it says error. I have more than enough space on my phone. I make sure to delete projects off of CapCut when I finish, and I make sure that the app is up to date on all updates. I honestly don’t get the problem but please fix it. It’s a great app I use it all the time-"
"I love this app, but I always wanted to do a smooth velocity edit. I’ve tried once before do a velocity edit with the custom speed. It didn’t turn out so well. Please add a velocity option. It would be really helpful. Also, I see videos saying there is a Graph option in CapCut but I don’t see it. I can’t update it. Why can’t I see the Graph option? Please help."
"Capcut is really amazing. The way you can short a video down, slow it down, chop it up add zooms and stuff is really great and how you can add audios to your videos but after 3 minutes of my editing the app gets extremely glitchy and you can’t see how the videos are doing unless you just download it and see for yourself because it’s doing so bad s"
The animation is super well but one day i was trying to use them but it kept on saying no internet please try again even tho I had full bars. ⟟ don’t know how to fix it! ⟟ tried deleting the app multiple times but it wasn’t working :(
"I was really impressed because of how quickly I new all the settings. It is very easy yet very quick, and you don’t spend more than 30 minutes each project. All of the effects and animations make my editing life 12x easier."
so each time i edit it comes out good most of the time. but on various occasions it pauses and wont play until i exit my whole edit. i have updated it and it is updated to the most recent update but still the same problem... so i am only able to play it once then after i play the edit it pauses itself and it wont play until i exit the whole edit. capcut please fix👽🙄
when I first downloaded this it was a little confusing but when I deleted it and downloaded it back again it was helpful and you get to use everything for free without the watermark love it keep it up : 💜 and I don’t even do reviews or rates on apps so you know this app good .
"So as a Gacha person I wanted to make an intro so I went to Gacha and made so photos then I went to CapCut said I needed to “Delete “ some photos I’m oh ok can’t be to hard to I delete like 5 photos and videos when back on still not enough, i’m like huh?? Alright I go back Delete more bro I only have 30 photos left and just deleted most I fav videos that I loved!!!!! What did this app do!! And it’s still not letting me do my intro!! 😡"
"I love LOVE to edit on this app, but your wondering, why 4 stars? Well recently just today, i figured out that the thing “style” has disapeared, i was like ok, they probaly updated it, or its a glitch , so i reset my tablet, and it was still gone and i was like okay update thats when i get on here and saw that theres no update.. try to fix?😕😭"
"Overall this is a good app but there is a glitch/bug. When I add anything (like effects to text and stuff) it says “no internet connection please try again”. AND I HAVE GOOD INTERNET!!!!!! Please fix this!!!!!
——————————————————————————————
Edit from developer response: Thank you for fixing the bug. Now I will give you 5 stars instead of 1."
CAPCUT IS SO FREAKING AMAZING. One thing that I always hate is that you always need storage for CapCut. I always delete my photos and videos and everything but it still says I need storage. But other than that I love CapCut it’s so easy for beginners! *hours later*I deleted half my pictures and half my apps. Still don’t have storage. I changed my mind.. hate this
I really really love this amazing app but there is some unknown issues.. it’s been telling me my storage is low and stuff but I deleted my apps and photos and everything and bc of this I can’t make a single video and my followers are geting very sad bc i haven’t been posting without my videos I can’t do anything so idk what’s going on plz fix it
"I used to edit on funimate, but when I found out about capcut, I never stopped using it. I’ve been using capcut for almost a year now, no complaints. 💞 I can’t wait for future updates! I’ll be here for all. Thanks for giving me such a memorable experience. 💞"
"I use CapCut to edit my video’s because it’s easier to use than KineMaster but the problem that I’ve noticed is that now when I register a screenshot to be 0.1 seconds it doesn’t show it like if it isn’t there and until this problem is fixed I’ll be using KineMaster though it’s harder to use and not free.

-Lion(Chris)"
"So I’ve done like smaller editing like 5 minutes or less, but the moment the project is longer than 10 minutes the app starts acting up. I’ll try and import audio and it’ll straight up be muted and I can’t change it. I’ve imported the sound once fine then when I need it again it imports muted. Furthermore when I save the file to come back to it in the morning half the files will be muted or blank if it’s video. This app cannot handle anything bigger than a tik tok or fan cam"
"This app is my #1 recommendation for a editing app. I make the coolest edits on here! I would enjoy if I could draw on my edit and animate it. Another thing, for Text to Speech, could you add more voices? That is all! This game is so awesome so if you are reading  my review and you don’t have it yet hit that download button right now."
"I love this app and everything about it. That I can share my edits with my friends and they can share theirs. But I do have one request, I’m a kid with no social media and can’t post my videos any where, is there a way that CapCut can also have a social media feature so people can post there edits on CapCut?"
I like capcut but I do have one problem and that is when I am editing a video and I want to put the vintage 2 affect but then you says that I need to connect to Wi-Fi even though I have Wi-Fi and I kept trying to put the bling affect on but it wouldn’t work and when I try to put another bling affect on it still wouldn’t work but other than that capcut is a cool app
I love CapCut but if I screen record something to use the music is I screen record it before the music plays I can’t remove that part and have the music play from the beginning but overall I think it’s a great app

i was so excited to have an editing all that seems cool but im absolutely grossed out and disgusted. i had faith, this is something atrocious and something i didn’t expect from you. will not be downloading again unless i see proof it is removed. 
you have several ways you can edit a body to make it “slimmer” and stuff ? that’s really triggering and problematic ?? please remove it. this has caused pain and fueled EDs body dysmorphia and bad relationships with your body and self for YEARS. i can’t believe an editing app that EVEN KIDS AND TEENS USE promotes this. if i had this a few years ago i would’ve been in such a worse place. this is one of the most harmful things we can promote on the internet."
It is completely perfect! Thank you for your product! But I would like to suggest to add function when I upload video from your app to camera roll I would like to have opportunity to split my project to 15 sec cuts for Instagram stories for example. Good luck guys!
"So over all, I love this app. This app is great for making my gacha club/life/verse videos! But I have this thing that annoys me! When you zoom in to see the project you made, there’s like a line that shows how much you watched it, and I don’t want it to show! So please fix that, but still. This is the best editing app."
This app is by far the best possible free app for video editing. I just use it to make “fancam” type videos of myself to make me feel like a baddie but im sure theres more practical ways to use it too and its a godsend that this app doesnt make you pay a subscription fee as soon as you download it.
"I love this app and I wish I knew it sooner because it has everything a video editing app would have + YOU DON’T NEED TO PAY FOR A WATERMARK like excuse me?? How are you making money off this app? I would recommend adding like a premium system or something but anyways, I would highly recommend this app!"
Okay so when I try to edit some thing it says that I have insufficient storage and I don’t know what to do because I do have enough storage on my phone and I can make videos and stuff so I don’t know why it says I don’t have storage so hopefully you guys can you help me .❤️
"Great app and amazing beginner editing app. No watermark which is a plus and many transitions and effects to use. I’m just begging you guys to let us add 2+ animations to 1 clip! It would be much easier than using 1 animation, exported it and then adding another animation. Other than that thank y’all for this wonderful app"
"Capcut is a really easy editing app to use, oh my gosh. Literally everything is free, and there are a lot of effects and transitions to use. You can even do simple velocity edits. I can not express how much I love this app. There is no watermark. It’s simple and cool for beginners. Overall, I love it and it’s worth it. But it does glitch sometimes, but it’s okay."
Okay so I 100% love this so much and there’s nothing wrong about it! But it’s getting my confused like it’s pretty easy but I’ve seen people make cool edits but couldn’t it have came with a short tutorial video? Just asking it’s okay if you can’t add a tutorial video! But I recommend this app 100% so people use this app!
"I use Capcut for all of my edits on TikTok and stuff but I do have a problem with it. 

When I export the finished edit, the audio will be off by a bit and when I watch the edit in Capcut, it's perfectly in sync. I think this needs to be fixed for all the editors in Capcut that need to have perfectly synced edits and videos."
"A previous functional feature malfunctions. So I can link up Tik Tok again.. but now if I try to zoom in on a video (and zoom into it say 75%) the next video segment I upload into the program, when I want to zoom into slightly to make my own transition effect, that segment now goes to 75% too and the video REFUSES to zoom out and it just is EXTREMELY irritating."
"I think CapCut is one of if not the best app for editors or just video makers who use mobile devices. The variety is honestly so good, you can add your own fonts, several effects and others. It’s also simple enough to understand and not all over the place. Love the app :)"
"All of the other apps made for editing includ in-app purchases , so you have to subscribe first if you want to have actual good effects, this app is quite the opposite, it has so many great effects and animations, and it’s really simple to use and works fast, I absolutely recommend"
THIS APP IS AMAZING !! Has a lot of edits to choose from and I mean they are just great and it saves in 4k!! I shoot videos on my camera and then upload them to my phone and edit them on here I love this app onlthing it could use a few more features just saying
I like CapCut and it’s a good app it’s just it won’t let me have the same effects like other people because I went on tik tok and saw there was a cool effect on CapCut and I wanted to try it but it wasn’t there and I tried to update it but that didn’t work either so I couldn’t even do a good edit.
"It’s so easy to do stuff on capcut, no watermark too! (you have to delete it) the transitions are awesome, and the chroma key works great! I can tween easily on here, although sometimes when your tweening for awhile it starts to glitch and move on its own. But just from this app I’ve gained so much support on my edits!"
"capcut i am loving these affects you added such as the new electric light border, prauge, indrescent, fold 2, and my favorite HSL!! (FINALLY)  youve improved alot these past few updates cant wait for more but can you do some stuff about the text feature like glowing or smth like that. Also add a few quality features plz #slay"
why are you tripping🤨 like this has been happening for four days and with the new “tiktok sound thing” it always says “no internet connection” when i have internet? LIKE i just wanna edit and dont wanna waste my storage on screen recording or saving it🕺 anyways my mutual _nourii is better at editing then you on your own app bye
"Hello! I’m here to leave a quick review for capcut! I don’t know start off, but what I can say is that this app is amazing! It’s useful and lots of people found how to make capcut look more amazing than it seems, this app is very useful and I’m glad it’s free! 

Thank you for reading this, have a great day/night! <3"
"Dear CapCut…

Thank you so much,I love this I’ve been using this for over like 8 months now and I enjoy using it! This is the only editing app I use now lollll.I tried using other apps and it seems hard for me! Nothing is better than CapCut (in my opinion) so thank you very much.

From: Jasmine ;)"
Amazing and Easy to use just one small thing. When I want to do the Anime filter it doesn’t show somehow… I look at styles and still no anime button and only the big-head filter and 3D Zoom. I am not sure if this is a glitch but please fix this if you can! I will change me rating to 5 stars if you can!
I had this for awhile and it really help because I actually understand it but sometimes theres things I don't like but its a great app but also Its sometimes says that my storage is full so I wont be able to do an edit and Id only have like 9 photos in stuff but CapCut really improves me
So I updated Capcut the other day and i didnt use it because it was my dads birthday. Today i went on capcut to look at my edits to see if its missing anything. This is what it said “ This project requires updated Note that this may consume cellular data. Install Now.” I pushed install but nothing happened and i didnt get to save them in my camera roll.
"At first, it worked great! However now, every time I try to download a video, it says I don’t have enough memory. But I only have around 200 photos in my camera roll and I have no saved projects. It also won’t let me upload any audios nor will it let me click to make a project at all. I updated the app and it seemed to have only worsen this problem. I was warned that CapCut acts up a bit but this is just really bad. I don’t know any other apps I should turn to but right now CapCut isn’t very good."
Hi I just got capcut today and it is a pretty good app but it needs more music with words. When I went to music some  of them where in Japan and I just could never find the music I liked but overall it’s the best editing app I have seen just needs more music
"In the beginning I loved this app it worked amazing.(I am a beginner).But now it won’t load my videos and when it does it just mixes up all the editing. I spend hours on 15 minute videos just because the app does all of this. I was happy but now I am very disappointed. 
I officially hate this app I have poured my heart and soul into editing these videos and they won’t even download."
"The app is great I love all of the music, transitions, etc. however, there is a small problem. At random points of the app it may lag out heavily or be unresponsive. Now this is ok at first but it happens quite frequently now. I’m not sure if it’s me or the app, overall amazing app and would have given it 5 stars yet the lag broke it for me."
"This app is probably the best editing app i have ever used with many many different layers and stickers which is awesome. The reason i gave this a four instead of five is because sometimes when i add a lot of pictures it tends to get really laggy, which is natural but it tends to do it more with this unlike other apps. But overall it's amazing!"
This is a best app for starter editors It doesn’t cost much money and the edits are free it’s really a good app to download I have tried it a lot when I’m about to edit don’t get me wrong lol. But yea this is a good start to practice there’s other ways to make edits a lot of people use it it’s really helpful. I always use this to make edits so yea!
I make funny content and don’t have much to work with as anyone who is just starting out I would 100% recommend this app you can add sounds and have close to unlimited possibilities not water mark 100% free and it’s an amazing app. Been searching for years and I’ve finally found a great app.
"I am in love with this app. I’ve seen a lot of edits that have those cool transitions and I could never find an app to do those, but once I found out that people where using this app to edit, I had to try it! And I have no regrets about using it. Honestly this is is the best app I’ve used for my edits! 🤍"
So the app is perfect but I just wanted to see if there would be some changes like  the following: once u delete the app u can make a account  for example you make a mini movie and the app gets deleted and once you Restore the app u have nothing saved and once u can make a acc it would save ur music ur projects etc etc. That all  overall the app is good great  for videos edits etc
"It has all kinds of features which is amazing! I’ve always been trying to find the right editing app, and this is it! Although I’m not very fond of how it goes back to the beginning of animations in combo when I go to the next clip. But everything is so perfect! I love this app so much!"
"First of all, it’s FREE! And it’s super easy to understand! No tutorial needed! With this app you can make edits, videos of you tube, stuff for Instagram, ANYTHING! I LOVE THIS APP! Definitely one of a kind! There’s super cool affects that you can use and tons of cute animated stickers you can put in your videos! I definitely recommended you get this app! ❤️"
So first I think all the other things on capcut are good not bad but good but when I’m trying to get a tiktok sound it doesn’t update I mean when ever I’m going to add a audio I see tiktok original sounds and I go back to my tiktok and then I didn’t see the sounds that were there so I think capcut just means to update the tiktok sounds.
This app is honestly AMAZING . It’s the best editing app I have came across so far ! What makes it better than the rest of these apps EVERYTHING IS FREE! You can add your own music you don’t have to buy. You don’t have to pay for NONE OF THE filters nor do you have to pay for the effects ! It’s honestly the best app ever!!! I truly love it!!!

Ok, this is coming from someone who LOVES editing. And i love capcut the only things i think you need to improve are:
-not being able to watch your own video with no storage left
This is SO hard for me because i have no storage and i really wanna edit
-not being able to import stuff
Hard.
-Not seeing, in the ‘let capcut allow’ or something along those lines, how to access photos
Hard 2.0.

                                                                      Love,

I just updated it and but still does not work. Ok so it doesn’t go on the next thing so it looks like it just the same picture for a long time. I dont know what to do and i dont want to uninstall it because i made a lot of animation edits on it… Please help me fix it. I dont know what to do…
So I just downloaded this because every video I watch has cap-cut so I thought to download it but I am not a YouTuber i still would like this. And I wanted cap-cut for a long time/when I sow my first video that got cap-cut and if you read mine thank you for reading mine!
"Hai!! I really like the app I’ve had it for a while and I use it for my gacha edits! ^^ but the only problem is, whenever I put Frames super  squeezed together, It’ll lag a lot and not show  the frames I put on the screen. That’s it! it’s really good overall though!! I also like how you don’t have to pay for like literally everything!"
"I use this app quite a bit. It’s really good and easy to use. Recently when I’ve been trying to press play or pause it either just doesn’t work or I have to tap it repeatedly. I did delete the app and reinstall it but it still is difficult. Again, it’s a great app!"
"As someone who used to use CapCut but now uses vs, there are some thing I wish it had. The to hi king I want to most is motion blur, if CapCut had that it would be the best. Another one thing I want is probably mirror edges because mirror edges + motion blur are the he best. I would say graph but in the new update we have graph! That’s all I have to say, have a nice day."
"This app is absolutely amazing! 
I came across this app a year ago while I was a beginner editor, so this was a big help! The tools are easy to use and the quality of the app is great. 
I’m glad you don’t have to pay for effects and filters like most apps do!"
"1000% better than any other editor I’ve used.  Easy to use, lots of tools, and FREE.  No watermarks, very little locked features, and more.  Can’t not even begin to explain how helpful this is.  Only thing that’s iffy is the filters but other than that it’s awesome!!"
"I really love this app. The fact that there is no watermark and that you can choose to delete the clip at the end makes it even better. The only problem I have with it is the slow motion. It seems so choppy compared to other editing apps. On the other apps, the slow motion is really smooth. That’s the only complaint I have."
"i loved this app when u first installed it, but honestly theyre kinda doing what instagram does. they updated it and i liked the app a whole lot better before the update. it did some thing with the audio, its obvious because i went back to old videos i edited before the update happened, and the audio to video ratio was very off. miss how it was when i first installed it 😕"
Capcut is ok. But some things REALLY annoy me. Sometimes when im getting a photo it says “no photos start making memories here” and i have to leave the app and swipe up at least 12 times. I NEVER have storage to create a project and i end up deleting half my phone until it works and in the start i didn't have much. Most of the time the app glitches and that really annoys me. I would’ve given 5 stars but with all this i give it 2 stars.
"I can finally make quality internet videos, without having to pay to remove watermark and spending hours figuring out how the app works. Cap Cut is just amazing I got the gist of it very quickly easy and it was fun to use, very proud of the products made with this app. 10/10"
"This app is good for stuff you want to post on tiktok or something but it keeps telling me that my storage is full then I delete 1,000 videos or photos and it still tells me that my storage is full again and then I restart my phone and then I still talks me the same thing over and over again. Please fix it."
"Love Capcut with all the cool things it offers, but my biggest issue is that, when I put a video in, it’ll dump the video quality down A LOT. I didn’t have issues with this the first two times I made a video, but now it just makes the video quality bad in the editing part and worse when I export it.

So good app, but the quality is a hit or miss."
"I mean I love The app but for people who don’t have a lot of storage in their device you can’t really do anything and I like making the videos and stuff with all my art and stuff but I can’t really do it
And you should make it where people with not that much storage can do it anyway I love the app"
"Great app I love it I use it for all my editing and videos/props. It’s amazing. My only editing app I use it’s great and all loves he effects and stuff. The problem is, when I go to edit sometimes, it says “Insufficient storage”. I have a least amount of photos, not to much apps. It bugs me and if it’s a capcut problem fix it immediately!"
It takes way too much storage! But other then that it’s a very good app to edit with. It helps me with a lot of stuff but it’s hard to edit stuff cause I love taking photos but it needs slot of storage and it makes it hard for me to edit when I need storage....
"I am overall in love with this app! At first I was getting confused with the many ways to use it, but I have been using it for a few months and it is now super easy! You can make such amazing edits on here in such little time it blows my mind! 100% would recommend!"
"I downloaded the app and was trying to make and edit while every time I clicked an option it said I needed internet. Though, all of my other apps were connected and working and I even tried reinstalling it and restarting my phone which still didn’t work."
It’s pretty good. I use it for editing my videos and just edits. I know a lot of people say it’s bad but it’s good the only thing I hate about it is that when you split the video I wish there was more translations like basic ones and harder ones but overall it’s good!
"I like this editing app like it’s the best one to me out there because like it has no watermark, it’s simple and easy to use!! But I wish you guys could add to where you can make the slow motion could be smooth. But anyways it’s really great editing app and keep on the good work!!"
"I think CapCut is really advance, way better than video star has plenty of effects and things to choose from one thing you guys should fix is the video time limit, make limited orblongervthsnb15 minutes. But anyway you guys should download capcut."
"I’ve been through so many video editing apps and it all has water marks or crap ton of advertisements or makes you buy a membership. But this app just lets you edit, great variety of options. Solid app, I made my car edits with it and it turned out great!"
"This is literally one of the best editing apps I have ever used! This is so simple and awesome. I edit for my friends and they want to know how I edited so good. I said that there is this app called ViaMaker and that the editing on this app is so simple, and if you do it just right, your final product could look amazing!"
"I love this app ,but at the 1 week of using it. The app stared pausing and it won’t even let me finish one of the videos. It keeps stock. I thought it was my phone but no. If y’all can help with this technical problem I’ll be ok. I love the app. And I’m not gonna take it off my phone. But it freezes."
"This app frustrates me and has disappointed me. Everything goes good until it comes to the end. I’ve done many videos on this app and there’s times where the app glitches so badly! And I just finished a very important video and it is due today, every time I click on the video, the app kicks me out! I’m so infuriated and upset. I worked on this for almost two weeks! Please fix the issue. If not, it’s time for me to find a more improved app similar to this one, which is very unfortunate!"
"I really like this app bc it’s easier to do edits and stuff. I like all the effects and all the many stuff you can do. It was overall good however, I didn’t like the way the slomos aren’t smooth. If I ever want to do a velocity edit on CapCut I first need to slow down the video on other apps which is very annoying."
I love this app because it has so many things u can do and edit and extract music.I like this app because when my best friend sends me videos I add them in CapCut and make it a cute video like in slow mow and make the I love u for ♾ meme definitely worth it! I’ve used this app for all my edits.
"Hi! So I started using the app way back in the summer and um Their is just one problem.. the transitions.. you guys can you add more key frames and make it more smooth? And Don’t change the graphs- but just make more smooth transitions keyframes also? Thank you!

 Sincerely,
Person who uses app-"
Over all I love this app I’ve been using it for only 1 year and i love it only thing a suggested is that y’all should make the speed smoother bc its really chunky or laggy so I would recommend making the speed smoother but other than that I don’t got much to say!
"Hello! I love this game and how I can make some good gacha life vids , The things I don’t like is that the storage is bad it always tells me that I have to much storage, and the internet is bad I couldn’t even make a gacha vid ! Today I was gonna make a gacha vid and then it said,”Couldn’t import”, which I didn’t like I tapped on the photo and said no internet connection, I checked my internet and it was on! So I waited a day but did not work . So I hope u to update it! But besides all that it’s fine game."
"Hello I have been playing this app for a month probably but now it says “CapCut would like to have access to photos” but now that I click confirm, it sends me to settings and there’s no button for me to access CapCut to photos? If you know how to fix this please tell me!"
I have been using CapCut for a while now and it’s amazing🥳 I haven’t had any problems with it it’s updates are beautiful and it’s amazing to edit videos photos and more I would extremely recommend this for editing and it barely lags at all. Five stars!💜
"I love Capcut because of all the unique effects, fonts, and tools it has like the background removal (which is SUPER DOPE BTW)! I like how there’s new effects being added from time to time. 

Please add the 4:5 ratio for video formats!!! That is the portrait ratio on Instagram, and I usually post my videos in 4:5. It would be greatly appreciated if 4:5 ratio could be added!

Sometimes, the video would glitch when I watch it in full screen. It doesn’t affect the video when I download it, but bothers me a bit when I’m editing. Hopefully, you guys can figure out a solution to this. 

Thank you and keep up the great work!"
Most apps will cost like five dollars but this is free and it’s 20 times better than any other mobile editing app I’ve ever seen just look amazing literally anybody can download this for free I don’t know it’s just amazing I love it ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
This app is a really good editing app you can add overlays transitions some animations and you have key frames but what I feel like what this app is missing the most is the graphs and things like motion blur. Otherwise it’s still good but adding those would definitely improve everyone’s editing experience
"Hi! As a GachaTuber I use this app to edit my videos. This app is really good and useful, and I highly recommend it to beginner editors. This is the best editing app in my opinion because it is easy to use. One suggestion is maybe add something that makes it easier to tween. 
Anyways have a great day"
"The app is good, there’s really no bugs I could find. But 1 suggestion is to add overlay shadows. When I add a photo as a overlay on top of my video it just looks wierd without being complimented with a shadow. Just like how your able to put shadow on text I would like to be able to add shadow to my overlays when I add a photo over my video."
This app is good there’s lots of easy ways to edit i think this app is great! There’s good sound effects and good filters and more! This app if more for beginners tho. But over time now there’s not a lot of sound effects any more or any special effects any more. Most likely copyright or somthing but i still think this app is good for beginners!
"So when I first downloaded CAPCUT I didn’t have a problem with storage but when I started using it ALL THE TIME it always asks me to delete something from my storage and when I want to make a CAPCUT IT SAYS “INSUFFICIENT STORAGE” it makes me throw my iPad ALL THE TIME I try reloading it,DOES NOT WORK I really don’t recommend hitting your phone/iPad on the ground but CAPCUT needs  to calm down with all this “insufficient storage” thing it’s getting really annoying.❌"
I know you guys have presets transitions but I kinda want graphs on this app because when I add key frames it doesn’t really look smooth and I want graphs on this app. I think this will change a lot and make this app and amazing editing app! So can you guys please add graphs for key frames I would really appreciate it!
"Absolutely terrible app. The fact that people payed money for this utter garbage to be advertised is shocking. 

The only way to delete something like an overlay or a sticker or anything besides the video you want to edit is by pressing undo. So if you realize you made a mistake, you have to undo everything you did after that specific edit just to delete it. Also if you want to delete a split you have to delete the entire part of the video that the split covers."
I wanted to write this to say that this app is the best in the world if I did not find the app I would have had so much bad edits this is the best app in the world to me and I love it so so much! I make so many edits like Roblox  and Minecraft  and gacha life even if I don’t need to use it I still use it so this is why I’m writing this.
I downloaded this and thought well just another lie underneath but oh boy was I wrong this app as made my tiktok’s so much better thank you so much for making this app and I just like making the videos so yea but I have no problem with the app and I say it’s a really really really really amazing app
This is a top notch app don’t get me wrong I love the app its just I don’t like it when I watch the videos of how to make my CapCut pictures anime I don’t see it and I am on an i ad and I tried on phone and it did not work so can you try and add the anime thing on my I pad and then I will change my rating to five stars so can you add it please
"Aloha! So I LOVE THIS APP and i use it for my channel, Glossy Lillies! NO WATERMARK, STICKERS, GREAT TRANSITIONS, so many of my fans often ask me which app i use, which is this app! 
So u will be thinking, Lilly, WHY WOULD U NOT PUT 5 STARS??? Well um, the reason is the volume! Its strangely quiet for me, or extremely loud! I was thinking u could improve the volume and stuff-
Developers, if ur reading this, u might be feeling terrible abt what i just said abt the volume so let me make u feel a little better :)
ITS SO INCREDIBLE THAT THE LAYERS, i can tell u put a lot of effort into it! 
What did we learn today?
BUY THIS APP ASAP
And maybe work on the volume
EVERYTHING ELSE IS LOVELY 😊 
Ty for taking time out of ur day to read this comment! 😁
- Lilly"
"I LOVE this app so much and I’m glad it’s free. But I have a suggestion for another effect thing, could you add a slower flash effect? It would help me so much with my edits and a lot of other editing apps have a normal flash then a slower flash. So if you could add that, that would be awesome. Thanks so much!"
I think that this app is totally good overall! NO watermark! 100% recommended for editing. The only thing I don’t like is that they need to give credit for the features that they might of copied from different editing apps example like the shakes. But I really think it’s a very good editing app!
I downloaded the app it was Amazing I loved it and don’t get me wrong now it’s a very helpful app but then it started saying “Storage full”and it got annoying because my storage wasn’t even full I got aggravated to the Point where I would delete it and download it and it would still say my storage was full but when I went on other apps it worked perfectly fine.👍🏾
This is a great app there are such great tools you can use and its all completely free! You might think then oh well they have a lot of ads. NO!!! They had no ads whatsoever. Its so fun and so easy for me to use. You have to download a lot of effects though but other than storage this is the best editing app ever!
"This app has the easiest tools to use, and so far from what I have seen, is completely free. I like using this for making YT videos and such, and it is awesome. 

Definitely download if you are looking for an easy way to edit little clips and small videos."
"I LOVE THIS APP! It it’s very easy to manage and all free,( i suggested adding more transitions though .)although I’ve experienced some problems. Whenever I save the video it becomes very laggy and the equality gets ruined when saved into my phone, I don’t know how to fix it, I’ve already tried deleting it etc. PLEASE HELP I really need this app!"
"it is a great app 5/5 stars would recommend but just the other day it stopped working and i deleted it and re downloaded it and it still didnt work it wont let me press any buttons to add text, overlays, etc i can only add transitions but i downloaded it on my ipad and it worked fine idk why its like that on my phone"
"I LITERALLY LOVE THIS APP!!!! It’s completely free, no watermark, AMAZING transitions, etc. I have an idea. Maybe you guys add like the squeeze effects or have the option to add squeeze to your transition like funimate added! The chances of the creators seeing this is low but it’s just an idea!! Okay but highly recommended this app. 5 stars. Bravo."
"So, I just wanted to ask you CapCut...what happened to the anime thingy? You know, where you could change pictures and turn them into anime? I dunno if I have it or not, but I’ve been searching, A LOT for that thing...either y’all removed it, or don’t want people using it anymore..."
"So the app has been working for me in the past but now whenever i try to do one of the animations, they always say can’t connect to the internet nor will anything load. I’ve gone different places and it still hasn’t worked. I’ve tried many things so i’m just confused. Please help!! thank you!!"
"CapCut is an amazing app but I get problems with it. There’s this one problem where it freezes throughout the edit. Its very irritating. I tried to re-download the app and other ways but it seems it still not working. Overall the app is great. I just can’t do anything because it keeps on freezing. I really hope you understand what I’m saying here, thank you."
"I used this app to edit before switching to video star when i had the money, this worked great and has premade transitions! Although i do wish there was an option to make your own transitions. But im an instagram editor ( my @ is _sh1r0u_ ) and i really suggest this is youre looking to get jnto editing !! ✨"
I’m trying to make an edit and I can’t Cause for some reason the style option is not there and I’ve tried everything and it still hasn't came back up it’s been like 3 days now and it still hasn't come back yet and I’m really frustrated and I need help
"My gosh I thought this was some scam, but it is no where near it, in fact you are getting a lot out of this app!!!! I really don’t need to say much because everyone else has already done that so imma keep it real short!! Just get it"
CapCut is awesome I’ve used it forever but my problem is that CapCut keeps getting rid of things for example auto velocity. I’m very frustrated about that because I use auto velocity all the time and now I don’t know how to do velocity edits so please I’m begging the creators of CapCut to add back the things you have gotten rid of.
I love this app so much and it is amazing to edit with i edit all my videos with it and post them to TikTok they might not be good but I am satisfied with how much Capcut has helped me u can clearly see I’ve improved through my videos ( Tiktok: JustLayla_Here ) i still have some issues time to time but it is still a great app I I really do recommend ❤️😁
"As of right now i am very upset with this app..
i started using this app back in 2021 and it worked really well and i used the auto velocity a lot! but today i go to make an edit and capcut deleted the style thing where you get auto velocity i tried uninstalling but that didn’t work it was great until this started happening and left me very disappointed."
"I imported a bunch of video clips and set them to a Template, and when going back into edit the clips within the template, the timeline previews do not match the clip you are trying to edit. It seems too complex for a phone to handle. I'm using a recent iPhone SE 2020 with updated software etc. I have hope for this app if it can get the bugs worked out!!"
I love how you don’t need premium to use the cool features! It’s really awesome for my anime edits. The only suggestion I have if possible is to be able to access the TikTok sounds without having TikTok. As I am not allowed TikTok but still would like to use the sounds. Over all a great app!
When I was putting a overlay on or whatever it wouldn’t go on because it said try again so I did like 5 times in a row so I went to so a new one it was loading slow I had internet now I have to delete the app and make it again thanks a lot and fix it so things don’t do that kind of stuff
"So when I play this game I made one right? I was trying to make another one but it says I can’t ,so I deleted the app and replay it, it says the same thing. When I was about to watch my own video and it says I can’t. So I deleted one video and this is the same thing. I mean it’s good enough, but please fix it."
"When I try to create an edit, it doesn’t let me add photos. Only videos. Once I’ve created my project and I go to add, it says I have no photos. This is very annoying and I hope you fix this problem

Edit: I fixed the problem! I downloaded CapCut two days ago and I’m already obsessed."
"To be honest, this is the best editing app I have downloaded. It’s really easy to use for beginners, even tho I have been editing for a long time, this is the perfect app! I recommend to download it. It has amazing effects and animations, and everything is completely FREE! 10/10"
I found that this app was really easy and simple to use and that I could import my own sounds I still don’t know everything about this app but that the fun of it and I can progressively make my videos better and better
This app is so amazing I love the effects and everything else but one thing you need to add some smooth slowmo it’s looks bad when you do it because it’s so glitchy your app is amazing tho 5 star love all of your work and I follow you guys on tiktok keep up the work :)
"I personally love this app, it truest gives you what you need for doing simple editing, and it’s even free! I would recommend this app to anyone if they are looking for something to use, it may take a while to get used to, but in the end it makes it kinda easy."
So I was wondering if you guys could have like feature where you can make part of the video like wide. Because I like to edit on here and make videos that are somewhat funny. But I just wondering of y’all can make a stretch feature.
"I’m not a super experienced editor but, in my opinion, Capcut is great! You can make really good edits (there are a few limitations, but it is free sooo), there are a bunch of cool filters and effects, and there’s no watermark. The only suggestion I have is to make the stock video library a bit bigger with more overlays, backdrops, etc."
So I have a blog and I usually make really long videos and when I edit on CapCut and I’m finally finished I try to upload it but then it denies me and tells me too “get rid of some Storage” even though I have all of my pictures and my deleted photos are gone so I can usually never upload videos unless they are short pls fix this
Ok so I’ve been using capcut for a few months and I’ve gotten pretty good with it. One thing that I think you guys should add is adjusting the keyframe speed like alight motion. It would make editing a lot better and a lot of editors would appreciate it. Thank you!
"There’s some stuff that I wish u guys added but over all u guys deserve 5+ stars for making a FREE editing app!!! Capcut devs I love you, as a child I can’t spend money on some dumb edits on these good apps I’m so glad someone thought of us children😭 thank you capcut please don’t change the app! It’s perfect!!!! Much love😁❤️"
"This is absolutely amazing! I love that it has no watermark! But, I constantly make videos and constantly have no space, so when it complains to me I can't make a video even when i have enough storage to. I hope they improve on this!"
"I absolutely love CapCut as an editing app I use for videos, but a problem I have is that sometimes when I press effects or, text animations and other things, it says I don’t have internet connection 🤔 when I clearly do. But still, over all it’s an amazing app to use for editing :) !!"
So this app is wonderful great but when you kinda pass the 1minute time it starts to lag cuz right now i am making a 4:00 minute video and when i shorten my clips it starts to lag but it stills shortens up the clips the way i like it so maybe can you fix that and still great app no watermark everything i can ask thank you 😁
This is an AMAZING APP I use it all the time but I don’t like it when it says your storage is full can you please change that? I’ve actually used this for like 9 or 6 months it’s an amazing app I really love it you guys should add more effects I also love the new update with the shortcut it’s really helpful
"Hi! I wanted to say how amazing this app is. When I first tried it out I thought it didn’t really have many good transitions, but once I started to explore it more I figured out it’s a great editing app with many great transitions! (Sorry if I’m spelling transitions wrong!) More people need to use this app. Talk about underrated 😂"
"This game is awesome! I used to have another editing app that had nothing like this. This editing app is life changing. I always used an app called splice that you couldn’t save the videos to your camera, add  affects like these or add audio like this. Over all I think this is a fantastic editing app!"
"PERFECT. This is like no editing app ever seen! Has all the transitions I want to make edits, NO watermark! (You can’t cut that off in photos or just delete it) And, THERES NO STRUGGLE HAPPENING! This is so easy to work with and if I couldn’t find this app, I would have been still struggling out there to find a app just like this, you did well!"
"Everything is working fine but there’s one thing that annoys me, when ever you have to find a transition (I don’t use the 3D ones) you have to scroll pretty far. So can you guys add like a section to where it says “Last used” or “Favorites”? Or even a search bar?"
"I was trying to use the effects on this video I was editing, but it said I wasn’t connected to the internet even though I am connected. I tried to reinstall the app, and when I did the video effects worked, but the text effects don’t work now, what should I do? Besides that I love the app!!"
I’ve used this app a lot and it worked amazingly well but it has been updating recently and I think with each update it starts to glitch more while you’re editing. I’m sure it can and will be fixed but other than that it has worked great. Good for beginners.
"This app is a great app! It’s also the best free editing app I used if not the best editing app period, but the only problem is chroma key, when you try to take a color off it takes a bit of another color off. Hope you can fix it!"
I was working on a project and mid project the style and 3D options were gone from one day to the next. Going on 2 weeks now. I was specifically using the 3D Zoom options in the Style feature and I know you all brought back the Style feature but the zoom options are still missing. Could you please bring the Zoom feature back soon?
"I've really enjoyed using this app, but for some reason, the resolution never changes no matter what I set for the frame rate or resolution.
 It's the same for all of my videos regardless off the quality of the source material, and it detracts a lot from what would otherwise be 5 stars in my book."
"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this app and I’m really great at editing with it
And I mostly love making velocity edits lol but what happend to the style option? The style option has the 3D options and the velocity option I just wonder if capcut took it off or if they just didn’t want people to use it anymore? Idk but I love this app ty!"
"So I been using capcut for a year now, I've been doing some edits, you know? And usually my all of my edits get deleted from capcut by itself without me deleting it. Idk if its my storage or a glitch, but if it is a glitch please fix it. Thank you. 🤍 UPDATE!! So my friend was trying to do a edit, and she couldn't find style to do velocity, i checked too and i didnt see style. Did you delete it?"
"First off I love CapCut- I use it every day (almost) and it’s so easy to use. The graphs are really nice, however I think it could use some better combo transitions. Ones like different shakes and ect, stuff that can be used in fancy edits and stuff. Although, I do super love the apps and affects, it’s really nice. 👍"
"When I first started editing I was clueless, I thought this app was gonna take forever to learn. I managed to learn how to manage this app in just 2 days, this app is very good for beginners but it’s ability’s is like Expert level. I highly recommend this app for beginners and everyone."
Well isn’t an awesome app to be editing on and whatever but I do really hate when eight update came out and when you try to update it it won’t let you and you don’t get that by the way that happens to me all the time please fix the CapCut😫😫😫😫
This app made me a lot of followers on tik tok when I was a beginner I was like editing these is gonna take me a week but now it’s takin me like 20min I love it I can do a lot of edits thank you CapCut needs to improve the pitch things only and it will be the best editing app ever made in history who agrees with me?
"I’ve been using the iPhone version for a while and quite satisfied with the outcome. The iPad version is missing the shortcut and camera buttons from the Home Screen. Other than that seems to work like the iPhone version. *** Oddly, the buttons appeared after I had force quit the app and restarted the next day ***"
"CapCut is awesome and a great app for beginners!
I was on there today and was editing, and i came across the speed.
I was confused at first but then realized it helped a lot to speed things up! :D

Here are my concerns: so like i said i went on it today, and went off to eat, but when i came back onto it all of my edits were gone?
I’m confused, i still don’t have them back. I reset my ipad, turned it off, deleted and added back CapCut but nothing worked.
Is there a reason? i’m very sad, if you see this please tell me!
Besides that, CapCut is great, i highly recommend it!!! :)"
"So i’ve been trying to make an edit on the capcut app but every time
i try adding animation,effects,etc.. the app tells me i have no wifi? i’ve been trying to switch my wifi turn my phone off and on again and it still won’t work? is there any way i can fix this bug?"
"Ok so this editing app is amazing. All my friends have been able to create masterpieces. But mine doesn’t work. None of the features will load and when I have full bars and everything else on my phone/iPad works, CapCut does not. I have only been able to access the features twice and I’m very frustrated that I cannot use the app for much."
This app is amazing and I use it for making videos when I’m lazy and don’t want to transfer vids to my computer to edit. 5/5 amazing app and it’s well made and has all the features a computer video editor would have. Amazing app highly recommend!
I love CapCut i use it for everything but I would love to have a coloring option to bring in our own kind of filters also if you could have to were we are able to put text animation like having the letters wiggle plus having them wave in then that would make this app five stars
"Ok so this app is really good but as you know it’s not perfect which am guessing you read the title          right?

Ok so um it’s a bit better then kineMaster the audio doesn’t fade out an in for no reason over an over again but SOME TIMES it glitches an you can’t here the audio when you cut clips but other then that it’s pretty good"
I love this app a lot I’ve Ben using this since 2020 this app is very simple and a very good app but it’s a little annoying when they say clean your Storage  i barley have apps so that is my issue with this app also when i put the bling it kinda glitches that is very weird but i love the update it was very creative and cool that’s all i have to say
This was such a game changer for my daily life I can edit in my bed without my computer and U had a big problem me and my sister shared a room so we have one computer and she studies there so now I can sit in bed relax in bed and edit my friend told me about this app and honestly its the best app but tbh I did not figure out how to add transitions hope it’s useful
Every time I try to edit a video it says ‘ur storage is full’ my storage isn’t full at all I checked many of times and went to my settings and still my storage isn’t full...so I deleted the app and re downloaded it it still wasn’t working but not even that it said it wouldn’t download because I have to many apps..I countered my apps and I only have 13 that doesn’t seem a lot to me...so I don’t know if it just my phone or that app but I’m gonna have to rate this app 1-5 sorry🤷‍♀️
I love the app so much its so easy to use and i can actually figure things out easily -w- i have always had a hard time editing on other app and this is the most successful one i have has lemme say thing (because of this app all of my friends are simps for my edits-) :>
I never write reviews but this app is so freaking amazing!!! Where has it been all my life! It literally has infinite ideas that are possible thanks to all the features of the app and so many things to do that bring out creativity!! 💕💕💕❤️❤️❤️💕💕
"I like the app. It’s a good app for editing but i wish there were more animations and transitions. I would like for there to be motion animations, not shakes, but a little bit of movement so your picture isn’t always completely still. I would also like distortion transitions and or distortion flip transition. I hope you really look into this!"
"CapCut, is a really great app. I don’t really write Reviews but Anyways that’s besides the point. It’s a really great app and all but I think they should let you make your own Graphs when using the KeyFrames because then it’ll really go Together and when you use the KeyFrame it wouldn’t look stiff."
I love this App SOOOOO MUCH I've been using it for the past year now I have tictok and I use capcut to edit all my videos I recommend but every now and then when I try to  add photos to a new project it says “failed try again” or somthing like that so please fix that
"I love this app but I’m sad the velocity got taken away , velocity is basically my whole account on Tiktok and I haven’t been able to post velocities I’m very sad and mad and I don’t know how to do velocity on any other apps and this is my main app that I use so can we please get the velocity back I see that other people are sad too."
"Maybe when you go to anime a video or picture, add a little area where you can search the name of the animation you want to use for the edit. If this isn’t already in there, if it is, then sorry!"
"I spent hours working on an edit and I went to download it but my storage was full so I deleted the photos and videos I used on the edit off my camera roll since every other time I did that, it worked. So I deleted the clips and after downloading it was just a black screen and all my work was deleted. Since I already deleted the videos I couldn’t get them back. I feel so stupid and disappointed"
"I literally love this app, I use this for all my edits, but may ask if you can add more unique transitions? I like the transitions that videostar has, but it’s to confusing for me. I was hoping that since I could understand capcut, would you please add more unique transitions, or combo animations?"
"This app is really amazing if you need something to edit your videos, it has a lot of really amazing effects and filters, and it’s really easy to make good edits I suggest downloading this app if you need to edit a video but can’t find any good video editing apps that are easy!"
"This app is one of if not the best video editing app out there. For months I’ve been looking for a free editing app with no watermark or subscriptions, then I found Cap Cut. This app has everything I could ever ask for in an editing app. I would recommend this app to all my friends."
"I like this app it’s fun and easy to use 🌝
But I also suggest for them to put a shake/wobble effect
Like when you use the electric box thing there should be a shake
Effect to come with it! ⚡️ I think it would be useful, this is just a suggestion I think y’all should add. 🙂"
"So, I have had this app for a very long time and I love it! But, there’s 2 things that annoy me.
1. Whenever I play the video and it has very short clips those clips don’t show and it only shows the previous clip.
And 2. Whenever I try shortening a clip, the + for adding new videos and/or pictures is in the way. This does 2 things. It makes me either swipe forward which wastes time, or it will make me choose a video/picture to add. So, the 2 things I want is:
1. A smoother play for shorter clips
And 2. Move the + to the other side.
This is the only problems I have and I hope you can fix it!"
"awesome app! here’s a few suggestions ^^. whenever you add effects or overlays we should be able to lower the opacity of them, and the green screen effect is glitchy. i’m not sure if that’s my video but it’s always glitchy for me and it’s irritating.. next id we could animate things on here, meaning that we could make the pictures move without presets, i get that this is a preset editing app but there needs to be a little bit more creativity. well that’s all i have for now, please look over this and consider adding some of my suggestions in, thank you and have a good day."
"I love this app it’s easy to use  I love that you can add your own music, Effects,Fonts,Filters,Backgrounds, and more THERES so much fun things to do with CapCut Im definitely recommending this app I make yt videos with this app and it’s amazing and it’s my only editing app I have lol definitely 5 Stars !!!!"
I absolutely love this app it’s so easy to use and gives you so many tools. The only complaint I have is that I wish you can organize your edits I am very ocd and I hate how my edits are a huge mess I just ask that there was folders or something of that idea.
If you go on my TikTok page (which is called dxlqx) I made an awesome edit and it took me a lot of time please go support that but anyways I think there should be a smooth slow mo because it’s glitchy so I rather fix that so it’s smoother because I really want to make edits without going on VSCO 😁❤️‍🔥
"Of all the editing apps I have tried, none are this good that are FREE. This app contains everything you can possibly do without paying for anything exclusive. This app might be my new best friend when it comes to editing. This is definitely a 5 star rating from me."
"This editor is highly recommended for me and I’ve been seeing amazing edits by other people, you should try too!

When I first starting watching edits, they were just, AMAZING! So I wanted to try too!

I first got on the app and OH BOY was it amazing! It made me think that this is amazing when I started editing! I first started on the iPhone and I’m telling you how amazing it is on iPad! 

You should add a photo editor and people can use that on the app! And add more effects and transitions and maybe let people change the color of the app.
Amazing app and its just the best app"
"This is the first time I review an app! I’m amazed at how easy, helpful, and professional this app is. I am so impressed that I literally took the time to open the app story just to write this review. I highly recommend! Keep up the great work!"
I have had CapCut for. Long time big fan. But one day I was a king a edit and whenever I pressed a effect it would say “not connect to wifi” when I was. I tried re downloading it but it never works what I’m saying it never lets me use effects and I’m really made because I’m a big fan of CapCut but I can use it. Please fix this because I want to edit or I will delete the app.   :(
So I had edited a lot of my Gacha TikTok/Videos in this app and I actually recommend people to use this but whenever it sometimes freezes/crashes and stuff just we restart it easy peaszy lemon squeezy so I like to use this app definitely highly recommended
I love cap cit beacuse it says follow subscribe and like and you can put amojie i like it sow much and its sow fun i love it it sow amazing and there sow cute and im showing this to my friend it sow coooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo i put 5 star for showing this comment its amazing cooooooool and my cousin say its boring she give you 1 star thats it any way i loveeeeeeeeeee ittttttt
"I would’ve given this app a solid 5/5 response if it didn’t mess up a clip in your video if it got longer than 2 mins, when I'm trying to edit a video some portion of it is off time and it ends up ruining the rest of the clip. I don't know if its just me, but its a major throw off for me"
This game is a good app to do like tic tok edits and stuff but if your like new to edits and stuff I don’t think this will be the best app for you it is sometimes hard to understand how to use but when your practice more editing you will get the hang of it there is more edit for like people that don’t really good at editing for over all it is a nice app🕺🏽✨
"I love this app and use it for all my edits, but I feel that it is lacking one simple thing: folders. The home screen of the app is very cluttered (especially if you have many edits made) and a simple addition would 100% go a long way in the mobile editing community!!!"
"I’ve used a couple apps for mobile editing and It’s a hard thing to get right. But this app right here does it all, and makes it easy on you. Best editing app that I have used on mobile so far."
"Okay so, you can adjust certain filters and there should be a button where you can save the filter you made so you don’t have to remake the filter and there should be some options of overlays for lazy editors like me"
"I’ve been on cap cut for almost a year now,and my father recently just put on age restrictions and I would love if u put this as 9+ becuase I can’t find any other editing app better than this app!And one more thing,please add more fonts on there I would love if you did!

Sincerely,Jillian 💕"
CapCut is an excellent editing app it has many features and many layers you can also upload your videos to other social media networks it also has many more features with the vip pass but besides that this app is a 5 out of ten. 😁
"i love this app. it lets me make edits for my friends and videos. the one thing i don't like are the lags for when it load but that's natural. anyways i love the app and i would recommend it to my friends and family if they need an editing app. great, amazing app and , once again, love it!"
Overall I really like the app I just wish it had some more features like different types of ways you can type out your words my last thing is I wish it had more filters but overall I love the app and I will keep using it🙂
"Hello! I love using this edit app because of all the cool effects without having to buy a premium, no watermark, it’s overall perfect but at some points it is extremely slow/glitchy that I can’t even cut a part of a video or select anything. If you could fix that it would make my day! I love this app a lot"
"Ok I am having no complaints with the app, no problems. Everything works out absolutely fine and the quality is how I want it to be. This ended up more then what I expected it to be. All I ask for is a bit more animation thingies. Overall it’s a great app and I totally recommend it!"
I like this game but it would be better if you ALLOWED TO SEARCH MUSIC you give me this music and there’s no music that’s perfect for my projects I make maybe add some music that’s on Apple Music and for people to search music for music on Apple Music I mean music like my songs know what you did in the dark (light it up) or maybe CITY OF ANGELS (some lyrics: sold my sound to the devil for designer he said go to h***)
"I love this app it’s better than any editing app I have tried but when I go to choose the photos for a project it doesn’t show the photos I just added I tried restarting the app, saving the photos again I even tried reinstalling the app but nothing worked I’m not sure if this is a glitch or if it’s just me."
"I think it’s a great app, however it keeps saying “insufficient phone storage.” Even though I have got rid of over 100 photos.  I have deleted the app over and over again but it still won’t work. I have fixed my connection and yet still won’t work, it’s really annoying because this was my favorite editing app."
It’s really great because you can remove that thing at the end I don’t really know it’s called But you can remove it and there’s some filters you can use and I prefer to use them because they’re really cool and awesome
I really really love this app! I just wish that the overlay amount wasn’t so limited. Also I wanted to edit something today and all of a sudden the app stopped working. I redown loaded it and it’s still not working :(. Every time the app gets new things added it crashes and effects don’t load. It’s very irritating.
"This app is literally so awesome and it’s easy to use and edit with but, The style option keeps disappearing I update the app but it’s just not there anymore..I hope it didn’t get removed because the velocity is very useful . If there’s a way to get the option back please let me know. Thank you!"
"I really love this app but it would be better if we can edit the combos speed like we can for the different speed things, and plz add more traditions and effects, and also able to determine the speed of the effects as well"
When I first got this app I was so excited and happy because most of the features cost money on other apps but on this one it was free! Keep in mind I got this last week. So I went to edit my video for my yt channel it said I had no internet and I couldn’t see the icons it was just grey. I restarted my iPad and it did the same. I checked my internet and it was all fine. Please help me I need this app
"So I think the app is great in all sorts of ways but, when I play the video its very glitchy. Like sometimes it stays in a part for while, while the the music is way ahead of it! :( Thank you for creating this amazing app but can you please fix a few things?Thank you."
This app is a great app for editing!! Everything is free and it is so helpful!! I can make a godly edit in 7 minutes with this app!! There are some glitches but that’s ok!! This is my #1 favorite editing app!! The animation is so cool. CapCut is almost like video star but much easier!! I recommend this app for everyone!!
"Hours and hours, months and months of work down the drain. I love capcut so much and it's such a disappointment to fail on me like this. The app was being a big buggy so i decided to uninstall and reinstall and all my months of memories and edits are gone. A login system that will guarantee this won't happen would be great. I plan to email capcut again about getting my stuff back. It's such a shame."
Capcut is a really great app and everything is free you can remove the watermark it’s so nice I love it but there’s one thing…/on tiktok capcut posted a video and on that video it had match cut but on my device it doesn’t i don’t know why but I would really appreciate it if capcut fix’s it. 👍🏻
"So I deleted the app thinking “I’d just re-download it again like normal” well that didn’t work it’s saying something about having to use a card/money to re-download it, I hope that’s just a glitch and I hope you’ll be able to fix it! But it’s a good editing app besides this"
I love CapCut it’s a great app for making edits and etc but I just wish that the videos exported and it don’t mess up the quality but besides that I think it’s pretty good but cap cut please change that because it really does  annoy people when have to do extra stuff just to make it have good quality
It’s a great app but I had to switch to KineMaster because every time you make too much videos it says storage for please clean up and I keep cleaning up and it never goes back again so I had to delete it and exchange from CapCut to KineMaster so it’s not that bad but I rather using KineMaster because there’s green screens and other future that are better
CapCut is amazing when I want to do a Edit of me and my friends  I try and it looks amazing I was a beginner but then CapCut help me so much I love the effects  you should  download it and it is free  and I just use it all the time and it is lit  that means cool I love it it has TikTok sounds and so many more great sounds I love it
I swear every time I restart my phone it’s there even though I deleted it and it’s weird. I keep making the joke that “ cap cut is haunting my phone” but that might be true. Other than that it’s a good app. The cool voice effects and the other features are endless. One of the best editing apps I’ve tried out
Ok so this is so awesome I love how you added the velocity on the style which is amazing also I would recommend adding Better translations and better animations because the one you guys have now on CapCut is pretty bad no offense. But anyways this is a amazing editing app so I do recommend downloading💕
"Everything is cool and very easy to use. However, I couldn’t sign in to TikTok for the sounds. When I finally could, it said I didn’t have any sounds saved. Now it says I need to have internet connection. I really want to be able to use the sounds I have saved on TikTok. Everything else is perfect."
Capcut should have more voice effects because i’m trying to make a edit and i had to go to “sounds>>extract sound>>to no voice effects so Capcut could you make a old radio voice effect and make the sounds have the option to have voice effects
"It’s all free! Stickers, text, editing, etc! It’s perfect! I would super suggest this. For beginner editors and for pro editors! This app is just like all the others. Except for one things... no in-app purchases or up-front purchases. No surprise fees, either. Thanks for reading my review!

ReviewsGirl2012"
"Before I downloaded this, I expected there to be lots of in app purchases or ads. When I installed it, I was surprised to learn that absolutely everything is free. This app is not like the other apps, and like it said, it’s too good to be true. What’s the catch?"
"When I first downloaded capcut, I wasn’t that good but I kept getting better and I really think this app is amazing! U can add effects filters, and more! I really hope everyone gets to experience this app."
"I really like making videos on here, its a really amazing app and i can understand it really well! i do have one suggestion, I wish you could be able to search a song you want for the video, if that was added i would give it a 5 star because this is just an amazing app"
Ok so it’s a good app but it is using my storage and I have to delete things to make simple edits and one time I downloaded nothing and it said it even tho a couple secs ago it was fine also I’m trying to re download and it just keeps loading so it’s not on my screen so I can’t take it down and it’s annoying hope u can fix this 😚
"The app is great and all, but something’s kind of wrong with the app for me. I’ve checked my version to see if it were right and it says it’s up to version 3.3.0. When I try to open one of my projects the app tells me it needs an update. When I try to update the app, it fails. Any recommendations on how to fix this?"
"If I was being very honest, CapCut is the best video edit app I’ve used so far! It’s fun to use, easy, and have tons of transitions and cool effects to make your video look awesome. If you are new I do prefer you to try this app out because it’s Actaully really easy, fun, and in general cool!🔥🔥🔥"
"I’m with the wifi and I have wifi it’s connected and no trouble on other apps but I came across this one and this one just has trouble. Wifi like seriously, I tried to fix it but I didn’t use effects for a month in 2-3, I did what I could but it didn’t work I’m sorry I’m giving this app a 2 star rating it seems other people are great with it but I don’t know what is with mine I’m very sorry it’s terrible."
"Hello To the person who is reading this, when I first downloaded cap cut I thought it was hard to use, but then when I tried editing it was really easy to use and had a lot of options, thanks to this app, I started a yt career! So I recommend this app!! Thanks for everything!"
"okay so. A few months ago I was trying to find a app that’s easy to edit on, and I found capcut! So I started messing around with the effects and having fun, doing all that stuff. This was the app that made my name be seen. And plus it is extreme easy to edit on. I love this app so much"
I love capcut and everything about it it’s a really good editing app for mobile and really easy to use although i wish there were a system to save your edits/videos in the app itself because my capcut was automatically deleted by apple to save storage and when i downloaded it again all of my videos were gone
I love the app!! I really do but I just updated it and now all the text in my passed videos have a whitish background behind it and it very annoying I was wondering what that’s about because I really enjoyed how it was working before I updated it.
I love this app but there’s one problem some effects don’t work it will say No internet connection but my WiFi works and Sometimes I’ll put my Data on and some still won’t work only a few will work it makes me kinda mad
I like the app it has everything i need no watermark stickers voice customizer filters text everything good but not 5 stars because recently after I updated it it stop letting me use all those things now I’m gonna delete it and re download to see if that’s the case but yeah other than that it’s very good
Can do most of what any subscription app can and it’s free. This is tremendous gift as it is pretty gross how many cloned apps are out there all vying for your dollars. I would gladly pay a few for this one just because what they have done is a good thing and the app is also good.
"I love it I love this app. I love that there is like no ads I love that there is no water mark I love all of the animations i love it I love this app. It’s easy to use and just fun. Thank you for creating this app. I love it!
One thing is maybe that you can create folders to put my projects but you dont have to."
The app is 10/10 amazing app but please allow us to add our fonts I want a certain font the app does not have and I want to be able to add that same goes for everything as well I want to be able to add my own custom things
"It’s working perfectly but, when I went on the app today, as soon as it opened it froze.I don’t know if it’s a phone problem or an app problem so I’m still giving you a 5 star review but that’s my only complaint"
Very good high quality editing app I myself have done many edits and impressed my friends. One single problem there is no dark mode for others it may not be an issue but for me it’s so annoying finishing a project in the dark and then getting blinded by the menu screen. Otherwise very good app
"Im trying to export a video but when i click on the top right corner to export it, a pop up says to give the app access to my device. It takes me to the settings, but i already have everything toggled on?! Help idk what to do but i wanna export that video!!!"
"So I am a classic 12 year old making edits about my friends and pop stars I have been trying to find an app for that, this app is a wonderful joyride and it is all free, I literally love this app and I think that everyone who loves editing should definitely download this! Thanks so much CapCut❤️"
"i love the app but when i am trying to click on small parts of the video, it is always a struggle with the transition still there. if for a new update you could take out the transition button when you cant add a transition anymore, it would make the app perfect, but over all. Nice Job!"
"CapCut is a great editing app. I’ve used it for a while on my roblox edits, TikTok’s, things like that. But whenever I see people saying “oh my gosh, the new auto velocity feature is so cool,” I’m disappointed, because I can’t update CapCut, nor do I have the feature. CapCut just won’t give me the option to update it. I just want to know how."
I love it so much but if they don’t fix this little problem that’s killing me I would delete it to people who have it or not get it to people that do have my problem is if I don’t have too much phone storage then I can’t make a new CapCut video other than that it’s a great
I love this app so much I’ve been using it for around 3 years now you might see some editors that professionals I’m still getting there I love the new updates my only suggestion as in “complaint” is if you could add more sound effects!
This is really easy to use and can make really complex edits really easily! It’s free too. I’ve been using this for almost a year now and it’s one of my favorite apps. So if your are a editor or are a beginner editor I would 100% recommend this app.
"This app is very good for people who are beginners. There’s transitions, adjusting, cropping and more like that. Very good, but, the graph option doesn’t seem to work. I put my overlay and key frames but it spins instead of following the way I want it to go. So please, if you could, can you fix the graph option"
"The app is easy to use and editing is fun, though there is a problem. I can’t use favorited TikTok audios anymore because it’s says “No internet connection. Connect to the internet and try again” but my connection is perfectly fine, please fix this bug CapCut."
"Alright so it might glitch I think it’s just because of my electronic but it’s really good it helps me edit Gacha videos and silly videos and all sorts of things so if your reading this and not sure what to do, you should download this! Plus it’s free!!!! 
Stay safe everyone!😷"
"hi capcut! can you add more features that are NOT premade, can you try and add actual motion blur, better and smoother graphs, custom 3d elements / objects, a stretch tool, 3d overlay option, and better shakes? you might think this is too much to ask for but im pretty sure a basic editing app has atleast a FEW of these"
"I’ve been using CapCut since day one, but when on the second day I pressed add, and it said my storage was full. So i deleted 193 photos out 200, and it still said my storage was full! So i deleted apps, and still, said my storage was full. Please fix this, or I might have to search for another app."
So I just downloaded the app and a couple of days ago and I use it for a Gacha life video’s or any other things I want to use it for. It’s such a good app I will and always use it I love the the things we can use in it for example like a filter for a picture or the stickers (I love the stickers btw) it’s so underrated and I would love to give this app a 20/10 in my opinion :)
This app is amazing even tho it says that storage is full it’s no big deal just offload some apps and come back in I’m a beginner youtuber and this app helped me so much u guys got to try out this amazing app trust me you will love it! It is the best game edit video in the world! I love it❤️❤️❤️❤️ keep up the great work!
"This app is great. It has allowed me to make great edits but sometimes I have trouble importing a video. It will say “could not import check you internet connection.” The weird thing is, I am always connected to the WiFi at my house and have no problems with any other apps? Can anyone explain?"
"CapCut is a good app for editing and it’s very easy to understand, but:

1.) When your finished editing and want to see your final edit it’s very glitchy and it stops playing.

2.) I think CapCut should add Graphs so it makes the key-frame smooth than it is right now.

3.) You could make the tutorial more specific because when I first started editing with using CapCut I did not know what to do, like where to find the animations, key-frames and more.

Overall it is a very good app for editing but needs a little bit fixing..?"
"So I had CapCut for a long time now to edit videos… but then it started saying I had no storage every time I wanted to edit even though I had storage…and I deleted it a lot and therefore it would work and then not work, I would recommend fixing the storage limit for that"
id like to start by saying ive never left a review for any app before…but CapCut really isnt just any app…as a video editor and broke college student ive tried every free editing app possibly created and CapCut tops them all. I hope yall dont change a THING because it s perfect 👍🏽
"This app is so nice and cool. So much free effects and in fact, this app has no watermark and all effects and features are free. I really like all the effects, and features you can do. for example you can access a anime filter for your photos, 

Definitely recommend this app!"
"I use this a lot for editing, but one thing that’s really annoying is that I can’t access effects and transitions. It tells me I have no internet, but I have full bars. (No, it’s not blocked in my country.) Do you know why this is happening?

Refreshing CapCut has not worked."
"The no watermark and all free effects makes this my #1 go to editing app! The animations are nice and look professional! The only thing I have to say it I wish you could change the speed of the animations and the speed and place of the effects/animations, then it would be literal PERFECT editing app!"
I love capcut very much it’s a great app to edit with but I wish it had a smoother slomo or velocity because it’s like a lag slomo and it kills me but like I said it’s a amazing app and also some new combos that will make edits look better but you should totally download this amazing app!
"Highly recommend this app, yhu can be creative while it being free very much recommend not for beginners tho sometimes when yhu first look at it, it looks very complicated but a good app. I swear other editing apps are not free yhu don’t have to watch ads pay for monthly. Good luck 👍🍀"
"I just did an edit but it stuck on the video and how I supposed to show my edits to my friends. If i didn’t edit it properly, my friend will laugh at me and mad at me because, I’m the one who edits my friends game. So, i give 3 star. If this happened again, I will give 1 star then i started to use alight motion and delete capcut ASAP. Please fix the bug. I really needs it."
So some people say it is hard but once you get used to it is easy know here is my review it took me like a month to learn how to use it but that is not the point the point is how good it is and for the like 5 months I have been using it it is a very good app 😃five stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
"This app is amazing I use it for ALL my projects it has great effects,great filters, and amazing other things (that I can’t thing of right now)

But there are still issues 
1. It randomly kicks me out the app 
2. When I save a project on my phone at a random part of the clip it just freezes and idk what’s wrong"
"OMG i love this app! it might take some time to make some edits, but its amazing! i really recommend it and think its best for an editing app. I absolutely LOVE the effects, they really make my edits stand out. Once again, i really recommend this too whoever is reading this! thanks you for your time."
That is really great is free and all and everything but when my storage is full and I clean my storage And my storage been not for is always saying go clean your storage and then I delete and download it back and it says the same thing and I can’t edit..
"I like the app I’d say it is good compared to most editing apps, although me and many others would love to see a feature where you could slow down the animation or whatever you’re gonna use."
"I like this because it doesnt really ask us for money like almost other apps but the audio isnt really what i wanted, i wanted like a file part where you import your audio in but i cant do that but just record the song i want. So please fix that."
"I’ve used this app for a while now, and I have loved it! There are so many transitions, effects, filters, and animations to chose from. The only thing I would suggest is to have more font choices or even allow it so you can download your own fonts on the app. Overall it’s a great app! Good job!"
Okay so someone on tiktok was saying “where did the style button go i can’t find it” so i wanted to see so i downloaded this app and looked for it and i can’t find it. Please bring this option/button back because i don’t wanna do velocity the long way
I have always edited on iMovie and the experience has just never been good but every time I try and get a new editing app it either is a monthly fee or has a water mark so thank you for making this amazing free editing app it’s the best out there👍
"Whenever I have a project, I would use CapCut, and when I was editing this, the audio was off and I checked to see if there was an update and restarted the app and realized nothing changed. I love this app and created pretty cool stuff. I would love it if you would look into this!

-(otherwise, I love this app)"
so i have had capcut for more than three or four months and i think it is fairly good! I just would recommend some stuff that video star has so then i can get basically a video star experience also you should bring back the electric light board! i need it for a edit so yeah!
"I love CapCut, I use it to edit my videos wich I end up OBSESSING with. I also wanna say, the app is great, and all but sometimes it won’t let me export my edits. Also, it can sometimes be hard to do certain skills and I find it hard to make smooth transitions in videos, overall, CapCut is great. Could use some working on, though🙂"
Overall CapCut is an amazing app but there are issues. The projects I’ve made over time will not let me edit them again and when I try to go into the project it says Couldn’t update try again later. This has been going on for awhile now and I hope they will update the app or fix it soon.
I love this app it helps me with my edits and make it look really good but why do we have to wait a long time for a smoother transition on speed when I chose a new setting and when my phone turn off it will start over
"Dear Capcut Company 
While looking forward to the velocity update waiting says for it to be released upon  arrival of the date I come to find out even after updating the application the addition of auto velocity was not there and I am frankly disappointed in the amount of hype this update got just for it to disappoint us all in the end. 

From: Disappointed CapCut user"
"Ok so first I wan5 to say th3 good things abou5 the app so first is I really like how easy i5 is to figure ou5 things and separate clips and music and #tuff, I also love how ther3ar3 a lot transitions an$ music an$ fonts!
But sadly there ar3 som3 bad 5hings I dislike with are…
There needs to b3 mor3 m7sic choices
More fonts
Filters
And maybe  we should be able to add like our own music?
And I really don’t like the fact that I only make like a five or 10 minut3 video an$ I can’t export it 5o m6 camera roll to post, but then a gain this is my opinion and everyone has there own opinions b75 I hope #omone sees this review and adds #ome of these thing# to CapCut!"
"I love this app and i use it to make short clips of things, though i have one suggestion to add to the effects. Maybe add a motion tracker so the video moves with the face. Again, it’s just a suggestion that I think would make it even more useful."
"I absolutely love this app. It has everything I need in one place. And on top of all that it is 100% free with No ads. Yes, you heard me right, NO ADS!
I was able to make an outstanding movie using this app. It uploaded very quickly. Overall 5 stars if I could 10 stars!"
"Okay first of all, the animation is really bad. There’s absolutely no graphs! I would recommend adding graphs (if it’s not too hard for you guys). And my second problem is THE STORAGE! I only like what 20 projects and the app wastes so much storage! Mine is literally 20 gb!😐 but overall the app is great and is amazing for beginners."
It’s a good app but then it started glitching to where when I would split a clip the clip that I just split would be a black screen and I closed the app and reloaded it multiple times and it still did that so then I deleted the app and lost all my progress on everything and then I’m trying to redownload it now and it hasn’t even started downloading and it’s been sitting here loading for 30 minutes now
This is the best editing app I have ever had in so happy thank you for making this app I have been struggling with finding an app that did not have a glitch and did not make that glitch delete my work I love this app so much good work I highly recommend 😁
This is a really good app it helps me a lot with my videos but when I use the remove background button it removes all of the video/photo and it makes me really angry or disappointed so can somebody fix that and remove JUSt the background?
Often I would find many glitches where it couldn’t import a photo where it wouldn’t let me edit anything and sometimes it will tell me I didn’t have any room when I had only two photos in my gallery it’s very annoying but overall a great editing app
"CapCut is saying that my storage is full, when i delete aton of my fav edits , games and pictures is says storage is full im very use to this app and not any other app this  is a very good app and i dont wanna stop using this app i cant make any edits 🙁 cause its saying storage full"
"I love this app and it’s FREE, so why only 3 stars?  Because there is no landscape setting for the iPad Pro 12.9”.  It’s ridiculous to try and use a device that large in portrait mode for a video app.  Please add landscape support.  I use it on my iPhone and it’s great.  Super easy to put together multiple clips, add a title, etc.  But please, the ipad app needs this most basic setting."
I’ve been with cap cut for 7 months now it’s a great editing app but I’m trying to use effects but the update is horrible! I cant seem to find we’re all the effects went I need them for my edit! I hate the effects update and please change it back!!!!! Or at least change it to where you have options oh my god!!!
"Overall it’s an amazing editing app that you should 100% get but what I do is I make edits not like vlogs. And since I do, I would like for you to add a time lapse on the black flash, like the time period, y’know if you want it slow or fast, you have the choice. 2. I would like you to add where you can use gifs on the app."
"Sometimes I get logged out of it, it makes me frustrated and nervous that I can’t make yt vids anymore, I would like you to fix that. If you could this would be Amazing and a 5 star review. I’ve deleted your app capcup and to maybe re-do-it! But it won’t load.    

Thanks for making this great game! 
-Alicat_Plays"
"I love CapCut, i do a weird social media occupation so I love this. no watermark! WOOHOO! But I really wish that it had unlimited layers or at least a little more layers- it would make my expirence a bit easier! But besides that it’s a 10/10 app that I recommend to my friends"
"A suggestion I had is for the effects. Some of them bounce around and stuff, but I wish there was an option to slow it down. So I ask if you can make an option to make it slow or faster please!

Thanks, 
-Hayden"
Yo how is this app free? It has so many awesome filters etc. and it lets you save videos WITHOUT a watermark!! I was beyond shocked to find this out! I originally got it just for fun after seeing the tiktok Sugar Crash trend but I think I might use this for serious video editing for my song covers! I love this so much!
"This has to be the most underrated and best editing apps that are out their. This is the first time I’ve ever wrote a review for a app that’s how good it is. There’s only 3 features I hope will be coming to the app in the near future. A glow effect, a cut out effect, and a motion blur effect. If these effects where all added I would be giving a 5/5"
"Okay first of all, creator I think your need a award of being the kindest and best person ever. second of all FINALLY AN APP THAT U DoNt HAVE TO PAY FOR TO EDIT!!!And the fact that it’s so easy to edit is amazing, other apps are so confusing for me (no offense) but CapCut is amazing, thank you so much!!!"
You should add a glitch effect where you can place the glitch where ever you want on the screen. And a animation that is like it’s moving side to side like a sway but slow and then it zooms in a little bit and zooms out a tiny tiny bit :)
"Literally everything on here is free, I like how you can remove the watermark at the end without having to pay. Just one small suggestion, is there anyway you are able to make the green screen quality better? It’s very pixely."
"Did they downgrade this app and took out features and editing options? What happened?

Update: I changed 1 star to 4 stars now they put back Style. Big Head is missing still though but I’m happy Style is back for iOS devices. It didn’t go missing for Androids."
Okay from the title there is a problem its the word “problem“ you see i have an ipad and i wanted my video to go faster so i went to make it faster and the button is black why? Why is it black?
I love capcut and it’s so easy and can make good edits! So now ur probably wondering why I gave it a 4 well because when I first got it I had Style as an option for my vids but now I can’t find it and I looked in every tab so I guess capcut took it away :( so now I’m updating it rn hoping that will give me style again
"This app has been really helpful and I rlly love most parts about it but it keeps making a video not sinc up with the audio correctly. For example, a video of me talking will make it look so stupid because my voice is completely off with the movement of my mouth. It keeps doing this over and over and it's rlly getting on my nerves"
"Hello CapCut! I don’t usually write reviews, but this time it seemed like I should. If you’re considering getting CapCut, I really recommend it… especially if you’re editing your Gacha videos or tiktok/insta posts. I was using KineMaster for every video that I edited, then I tried out CapCut. CapCut has much features and I would rate it a 9/10. :)"
"—Capcut is BY-FAR!!!!!!! the best edition app for anyone who’s beginning in editing, It’s is very easy to learn about and catch up on how to use it

—I LOVE THIS APP, even tho it has its downfalls  which is usually not having an effect u want, BUT this app makes it easy to make that effect your own.
 

—Also, capcut (imo) it’s prolly better used for picture editing and not video- BUT from my experience capcut makes a PRETTY good video editing and will blow ur mind

—ALSO p.s
i’ve had capcut for about one year and the amount of improvement i’ve made is INSANE!

💯💯💯💯💯

-Thank You"
"It’s a great editing app, but one thing I find pretty annoying is when the video gets over about 10 minutes it starts to get pretty laggy. And it takes up quite a lot of iCloud storage. But other than that I have no issues with the app over all!"
Basically I was gonna use CapCut but when I putted my photo it didn’t pop up 🤨 it was just black I asked for help that didn’t work plus after a while after re getting the app the next day it says I’m “internet not connected” “check your internet” my internet is fine 🙄 and working fix your app for now I’m going back to KineMaster 😘👋🏽
"I love this app so much especially all the free features it’s the best thing ever I was wondering if you all could make a motion tracking optimization so I could motion track overlays and videos and photos I think this would be really helpful, but other than that this app is amazing no ads and love the quality."
"This is is amazing with editing! But sometimes when I try to make a new edit, it tells me I have to much storage but my photos tell m Eli don't and it’s becoming to get on my nerves and I don’t like when it happens when I’m just trying to edit"
"I love making edits and stuff but for some reason now nothing will load like a can pun in pics and add music but I can not do effects, filters, or my text effects. It’s saying that I’m not on WiFi but I’ve tried everything even on my hotspot pls try to look at this."
This is a very great app but this is a lot of megabytes and then it turns into a gigabyte and I don’t have that much space I only have 32gb my dad got me a cheaper one and I would like more space but I don’t want to pay for anything so can you lower the megabytes or do something else in the app
"hello! As a capcut user this app is really easy. I do have some suggestions for the app, i think adding motion blur and keyframes and definitely some more traditional movments also i think it would be super cool if there where some temples. I also think after effects would be a great app for inspiration :) over all its amazing:D"
Ok the only thing I have a problem with is that I literally have no photos or anything and I don’t have a lot of apps yet it still says I have no storage and I’m not allowed to make anything at all also it can be rlly glitchy sometimes and won’t let me see my photos
Ok so its awesome and all but true problem is that you have to have less storage to see and export this stinks I have deleted almost everything I have and still won’t work seriously how much room do you need to export OR EVEN EDIT THE CLIP people that’s reading this and wants to download this be aware of what your deleting cause I lost my dead cats pictures cause of the dumb app!!!
"capcut requirs access to the album for editing and saving videos
But every time i click on confirm it bring me to settings. I already have let it have full access to my photos so i don't know whats going on."
I got into cap cut and it was perfectly fine the other day when I got in today it wouldn’t let me add photos and when I tried to go to settings it would only let me change the notifications and Siri thingy I have no idea what’s going on I deleted it and downloaded it again cap cut can u pls help me?
They should change some parts of the app like when you trim the individual videos the effects and overlays automatically adjust to that part of the video instead of having to go back and adjust all of them manually.
"Cap cut is amazing! It’s great for gacha, tik tok, editing, etc.
The watermark is free too delete! (For you tik tokers or gachatubers.) But also EVERTHING IS FREE!! It’s amazing I love it! One thing is that the audio keeps going when you export. (Annoying sometimes) Overall this app gets five starts!! Thank you for reading!"
"so basically capcut has been working fine for a long time now, today though the transitions are glitching? like their stopping in the middle and then restart. I don’t know how to explain it but basically when i try to put a transition it just stops and glitches and then goes on. it’s so weird and it has never happened before. please help !"
"When I try and crop an extracted song or sound it makes me have to drag it so it won’t be separated. It just makes me take longer and it frustrates me. But it is a really good app, I used to use KineMaster but I really like this application. If you could fix the crop and move thing I hate that would be awesome! Thanks!"
"I love this app, but I can’t do ANYTHING a fun with it! Every time I try to use filters, animations, or effects, it tells me to check my internet connection! It is ALWAYS on, and the app hasn’t changed anything about it. It’s very annoying, especially because for SOME people it works, but not everyone. If that were fixed, then ABSOLUTELY five stars. The internet connection is definitely worth three stars though."
This app and Roblox is the best combo ever!  This is great for new youtubers and their are so many great things about the app. And the fact that it is all free is just amazing. I used to spend money on all these other apps until I found capcut. It helped me grow my tiktok account too!
Honestly for a mobile editing app this is PHENOMENAL! So many effects and there are LAYERS !! Of course it would be great to see some more transitions in the future and other effects but I’m absolutely loving everything already! Great job to the creators and thank you for making it watermark free ! You guys rock!
"So I’m making an edit with 9 removed back grounds and when I remove the background on a image other than the the first, it cuts out the back ground. But in the shape of what wasn’t cut out in the 1st image. There’s also some other bugs h other than that it’s really good and I love the app. (It’s allllll freee too❤️)"
Honestly this app is PERFECT if youre looking for a good editing app for edits and easy to use this is the best app especially since it’s all FREE I think the only thing that I’d change is add some more effects like more aura options or some animated frames and stuff but other wise this app is amazing.
People have been saying a lot about this app that it’s not very good and all that crap because I’ve used this app for my transition and one edit a made using this app managed to gain me 20 followers in one day this app is amazing despite what anyone else says keep up the great work!!!
"In my opinion it needs Green screen support, and a picture in the picture thing kinda what iMovie has (don’t get me wrong I prefer this editing app over anything) but that’s pretty much it I don’t have any more complains"
The app is good but it could be a little bit better like maybe adding a recently deleted thing..? I just deleted a edit and now I cant get it back:( That would be great if you added that thanks overall the app is good but it could have some adjustments!!
there’s one thing it takes up to much storage there should be a clean up button for storage if it gets filled you can get rid of edits that take to much and have it recommend witch ones to delete or not
Alot of people are requesting 3D effect or text animations! I think thats a very good idea! I also have an idea of being aloud to add in-animations and out-animations at the same time because some times i dont really like the combo animations.
It’s okay although I don’t like how the fade in and out have little flashes of blur. Overall the rest is good and i like that it has velocity so I don’t have to spend hours trying to make it when the slow motion isn’t smooth
"Recently whenever i try to manipulate graphs between keyframes, as soon as a select a graphing option (custom, ease out, etc) the latter keyframe point automatically crops itself to original size and centers the video/photo. really messes up transitions and has put a hold on me making things as often as i would like to. Seems its a really bad bug multiple people are experiencing. Nothing I do fixes it."
"Capcut is a really useful app! I really enjoy making edits here 100% worth it, Capcut is one of the top 10 best editing app, there’s only one problem…Nothing! I love this app so so much if you didn’t download this app you’ve made some bad life choices! This app is the best:)!"
"I love this app! It has so many choices of stickers, word fonts, and more! With the audio I love how you can sigh in to Tok Tok and have a lot more audios, but the sighting it part is not working for me, like the way with when it says to sign in with google, it won’t let me. I hope you can fix this shortly!"
"Honestly , if you want to charge me a little for this app, you can. It's that good. It makes my editing process so easy. Even if I'm just doing small video edits for myself, this has been the smoothest editor I have used on my phone"
"It’s a good app and I like it but I have one problem with it and it is the remove background option and when I use it , it removes the background yes but it also removes the picture or removes part of the picture so i am annoyed but other than that it is good"
"I love CapCut I use it for all my edits but I have one problem so I sometimes recorded theAudio and extracted but like there a silence in the first half so I edit audio when I try edit the video to make I shorter I wnat the first part to be shorter but I makes the last part  shorter 

And I like CapCut cause it’s good for everyone ❤️"
"For the voice effects in would love to be able to select the time in which I want the voice effects to be activated. I don't want the whole video to be the chickmunk voice, I want it to be a part of the video not the whole thing please change that thanks :)"
"As a developer, and visual design editor for our company I’ve used several (actually30) apps and the full Adobe suite and I can say this app is the best your going to see when it comes to mobility. Let’s continue to support and help upgrade this thing. Just wow!"
"I was using the remove background tool one day and it was working perfectly. Today i went on to use it again and it was cropping the background super badly, cutting off lots of parts of me and including lots of the background. I hope this gets fixed cause this was a great tool."
Easy to use and learn how to use but if you video gets longer than like two minutes it starts lagging too much to continue. And I exported a video that was five minutes long and barely any effects took 30 minutes to export and when I watched it through all the clips had been put in a random order.
I have just started CapCut and it is just amazing I thought VivaCut app was gonna work out and apparently I was wrong. CapCut is so much better iv had so much fun with this app and I recommend  100 percent when you are editing I have made the best edits with this app and mostly everything is free!
"I would spend hours editing a vlog video and every time I tried exporting it, it kept saying “something went wrong”. After trying again, it finally finished BUT it said “insufficient storage”. It doesn’t make sense because I have so much storage left and how it would tell me that at the last second. PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD FIX IT!!!! This upsets me."
It’s amazing wonderful great but… it could use another background like behind the counter for a cafe or a cafe background I’ve always wanted to do a cafe vid but I can’t I’m public it’s to loud so if you could make a behind the counter cafe back ground and a cafe background it would be the best pls
every time i edit a video it says my storage is full and i deleted a lot of things but it still said it was full. it takes so long to upload my videos. it doesn’t even work but before it had no bugs but now it does🤦🏽😤
"When I first heard about this app I was scrolling through TikTok.  I’m telling you, you find everything on that app.  But Capcut is good for editing videos and even pictures.  Way better than Videos star or VSCO.  I totally recommend this.  No bad reviews from me!"
Ok this app is good but the thing that stops me is that is saids is full and i deleted all my photos and my project’s but still said the same thing 😒and i reset my phone and it happened the same thing!
"This editor has no water mark and it’s easy to use and free but there is one thing that it needs a thing to cut out for images, and videos frame by frame but other than that it’s a really good editor thank you CapCut"
I can say this confidantes as I have used many. Not only is this totally free but it has no watermark. It also has Soooo many more features than some of the apps you’d have to pay to use. 12/10. would recommend.
"I don’t know where to start. I was making a video. This had taken  me 2 days and I wasn’t even half way done. Fanpages are the ones that mostly use this app yet yall fail to make them happy. I’m a fanpage, and you deleted my video that I was making. It isn’t funny at the fact this took up most of my storage and time while I could be doing other things. Please give the video back. It has aesthetic videos of charli damelio, nailea devora , and ariana grande . Thank you."
Thank you for CapCut but there’s just something that’s a bit off you see other apps have nice shake effects and there’s not many good ones to pick there I some really good animation tho but they can’t compete with your animation but they can by using shake effects
I use this app so much it’s so easy to figure out and sooo easy and just make good edits it’s just so easy to make good edits you can either put up some old memories and show it to some family or make new memories and show them to friends it’s the possibilities are endless
"I love CapCut. It amazing for basic editing and it has no watermark. I think they should add custom transitions. You could use keyframes for this but it doesn’t look very smooth. Also, I think they should add some type of custom motion blur for transitions. Otherwise, this app is amazing"
"I mean tbh, the app is great for editing and everything.. but for me when I’m editing it’s super laggy and i can barley watch it without it lagging . it’s hard t use the app when it’s always lagging when i try to edit and when trying to upload it won’t alow me to . I love the app but I would just like to see it improved ty and bye !!🧍🏾‍♀️"
"Also please keep this free forever. I HATE video star. It takes so long and costs money. I love this. This is easy to use, has ton of edits and helps me so much for my insta edits and edits for my friends. I’ve been recommending this to all my relatives and friends. I hope you keep this free forever"
It’s a really great app like very good! It’s just that whenever I want to overlay something it never works. Ex: I put. A picture and I decide to put words on there I tap the overlay button and nothing happens. I’d really appreciate if you could fix this bug.
I love this app but every time I export something it comes out super choppy. I’ve checked the frame rate on my phone and played around with the export settings and every time it comes out really choppy. One time I had to re-edit an entire project with another software cause it came really choppy.  No matter how much I mess with the export settings it always comes out choppy.
Whenever I try using the bling effects it tell me I have no internet connection. Please look into fixing the issue I really enjoy using this app for edits but haven’t been able to do so with this glitch. Thank you!
"Hello, these days I’ve been having problems. I don’t know if it’s slow but when I was to add a transition, I can’t see it. I don’t know if it’s loading but I restarted my phone. Downloaded the app again, and it’s still like that. I’m annoyed by that. Now I can’t use this app anymore. I can’t even change the font. Please fix it, I’m going to find another editing app."
Liek I said it's good but it was hard for me to understand it when I first got it and I'm still sorta confused but there should be a tutorial in the beginning so your not confused while trying to make a video and then get mad and delete it but that's my suggestion otherwise it's a really good app!
"Viamaker (now CapCut) is very nice! It comes with basic features like transitions, PiP, titles, stickers, overlays, audio tracks, effects and animations. The app is free and does not appear to include in-app purchases. 

More recently, the app added chromakey and key frames.

I may be asking too much, but it would nice to rotate the canvas horizontally."
This is by far the best free editing app I’ve found and I love it. The transitions and effect are awesome love them. But sometimes the video lags while I’m editing and idk why but it could just be my phone. Overall it’s nice and I’m for sure going to keep using it in the future.
"This is a great editing app, accept when I import videos to edit, the audio from the original video is off. I can’t just re-add the audio, because then I can’t add things such as voice effects. I hope this issue gets resolved, but other than that, this is a great app! I would highly recommend!"
"It’s got no adds or in app purchases that I know of and it doesn’t have any real errors 
It’s good for transitioning in videos and has really good effects the only reason that I give it a 4 star is that it doesn’t really have a way of sharing videos but it’s a good app to have"
"It’s good for editing,smooth, and uploads in pretty good quality. Overall I’d say amazing app. Although I personally have some issues. For example, I cannot use the “auto velocity” style option. It just doesn’t appear for me. I was wondering if there’s a way to fix this. (And yes my app is up to date)"
I’ve been using this app for about a year. It’s been great until I’ve got my new iPhone 13!? When I update the app it takes away things I can’t use as many effects and crashes. Also I just I just updated the app and now it won’t load any animation or nothing. Please fix this I don’t want to have to move to another editing app!
Hi don’t give me wrong capcut is a really good editing app! BUT i was editing and i went off the app for just a second and capcut deleted ALL my edits and it told me terms and conditions and how to use it:( i was working on an edit that took 3 hours and it deleted the whole thing including other edits i have made please fix this now andd FREE MOTION BLUR IS A MUST GOOD
"Hi, so I’ve been making a lot of edits that have overlays, and I need to make the overlays slower because when I want the overlay to move across the screen, it’s too fast. So please make the overlays available at ALL times. Thanks."
"This is another part to the photo problem, the best way I can describe it: It goes all good then all of a sudden it freezes on one photo and glitches on that photo and then skips like 5 photos and then shows another but that’s the best I can describe the problem."
I love this app it has amazing effects etc. BUT I’ve been useing this app for a while now and some glitches have appeared on here like when I downloaded one of my edits when I took out a part it replaced it with a text message that would be removed but put back :/
I love playing is I make so many video of is the 1 day I got it I did 5 video is it so easy and fun u can do Roblox videos and  videos of u it is so much better than any other editing app I ever had so if you look at a add to make video is this the 1-frog🐸😏🍄
"I really love the app but it would be nice if you could add a few more layers in your projects, i want to animate a character moving but i cant add enough layers to put all the parts in. Other than that i love everything about the app! ❤️"
"i love this app, its super simple and easy… but thats the thing, its good for new editors but once they get good they are gonna use alight motitor something. So some improvements you should make are better keyframes, graphs, and the ability to make our OWN transitions like alight motion, other than that i love it"
"This editing software is way better then all the others, even those where you have to pay. 10/10 would recommend to anyone"
"I’m an editor, and I highly recommend CapCut! I love the app and have had it for about 5 months. It’s easy, full of fun stuff, and free! I highly recommend for beginners The only con is that it takes up a lot of storage, but that’s it! This is my honest review of the editing app, CapCut."
I love it all it’s easy to use when you watch a tutorial it’s the best keep it up I love it I bet nearly all of the famous ticktokers out there are famous because of CapCut! Thx alot I’m really happy now since I learned how to use CapCut once again thx a lot!!!!!
I wish that there was a recovery option to recover my edits that I accidentally deleted or wanted to retrieve back but I’m disappointed at the fact that I spent days editing this one particular edit and accidentally deleting it and can never get back. My phone didn’t even back it up either. 🙄
So when I downloaded this it was cool but when i tried the “shortcut” IT WAS AMAZING i edited my video and it turned out amazing i also love how you can add music this is an amazing app if you want to edit! I highly recommend downloading this app it is amazing i give it a five star rating!!!
I love this beginner app it’s my most favorite and without this I cannot do a channel but it keeps saying that I can’t upload a file so I can edit i thought it was a bug/glitch but I uninstalled it and it made it worse please help it!
"This is the best app I found for editing, and I love that it’s free! The only problem is that the app itself is quite laggy (most of my friends have the same problem) and crashes occasionally. That makes it hard to edit consistently, but other than that, really great!! 🧡"
"I like the app and the effects and everything but although there is one thing i really want to recommend you, is that please add more overlays because i cant stack more overlays for my video its would be helpful id would do that i will also give it a five star if you would do it."
When i tell you this app is AMAZING 🤩 i absolutely love the app and i think it would be even better if u keep the premade transitions and add a thing where you can make ur own transition also where you can make a custom mask for your edit thats all i want to say
This app has helped me with better edits and I love it a lot I never get bored of it and I love it I’m like addicted to it I can stay on this app for days loll but thx for making this it had really really helped me with edits and everything so thx so much u need a lot of credit thxxxxxx❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
"Has everything I need for editing and video edits! No water mark which is absolutely AMAZING, tons of choices for effects and even photo editing like 3-D zoom which is also very amazing. I love the animations aswell as the text options! Awesome for editing would 101% reccomend!"
Soo like I said one bug happened so once I deteted the app and rn when I tried to download it again. Oh and I’m on Apple iPhone it didn’t let me download it it’s taking forever if so if it’s already downloaded I’m sorry for being mad and rude. If not and it’s a bug or glitch please fix it.
"So I am a Gacha maker, so I thought for a long time, what kind of app should I use? THEN THIS SHOWED UP. MAN, NOT EVEN 2 MINUTES AND I ALREADY MADE LIKE WHAT, 12 VIDS!!! I AM SUPER AMAZED BY THIS APP! IT HAS ALL OF THE AUDIO YOU NEED, ALL THE ANIMATIONS YOU CAN THING OF! So I just wanted to tell the creator that they did an amazing job on this beautiful app. I hope everyone enjoys this app. BYEEEE! HAVE A GREAT DAY / AFTERNOON / NIGHT!!!"
"I love this app these graphics are amazing one thing that bothers me is whe I get confused lol so I love this app I’ve been learning new things and there awesome the effects and the titles I love how the colors and all the stuff I just love this app I keep saying that but ITS AMAZING UGH I cant I’m obsessed that’s all I need to say AHHH 

-Sam"
"don’t get me wrong, I love this app, it has so many great features not to mention no watermark! However a few days after I installed I realized when I crop/lengthen clips it suddenly freezes for a few seconds. I’m not sure why this is happening but it’s quite annoying"
I got the app yesterday and i am in-love with it.  It has no adds!!! The edits i can make with cap-cut is very cool!  This app is perfect.  I haven't really used it a-lot yet but if there is anything else i will write another when i have a opinion about what you should change.
"So the app is AMAZING. And free. NO WATERMARK and its great for making videos but...for some reasons, there’s days that the buttons don’t work. I was to use a cool effect but every time i press it, it doesn’t do anything. It takes a few hours for it to work. But why don’t the buttons work?"
"This app is GREAT and recommended but here is the thing: it won’t let me add texts, change the filter or anything on the bar below. The only thing that did work was the adjustments. Can someone explain how to enable the things?"
Ok this app is amazing it really improves the quality of my videos. It would’ve gotten 5 stars but some of the effects that I use have be taken you why is that? Overall if you are looking for a really awesome video editor I would choose this
The transitions they made are pretty good they should make more though and add motion blur/tracking blur and colorings. But other than that it’s pretty good! The video quality is top notch and the frames are amazing because you get to save it so high which is not in a lot of editing apps.
I’ve been trying to find an app where I can edit without having to pay money that I don’t have and I’ve been looking for years and this app is the best thing to happen to me and I’m so glad that I found out about it 😌😌
"This is typically my go-to app for making edits. But a problem has occured quite a few times where one video clip will freeze for a couple seconds before going to the next clip. I've tried updating, restarting my phone, trimming things differently. Idk what else to do"
"Literally the best editing app I’ve ever come across. First off, all the tools I need to make a great edit are free!! That’s mine-blowing and there’s no catch. The edits I make look advanced and have a high-quality style to them. I’m obsessed and now I’m so excited to make more edits in the future."
"ok so im only rating this five stars so people can see this and here’s my story (well ofc in general i love this app and will rate it 5 stars but i’m keeping this up until they fix the bug…). i came to the app store and updated my capcut because it said i needed to update. i came to make my daily velocity edit but when i clicked make it smoother and then click better quality, after it processed, there’s a weird green flash. thank you i hope you fix this bug capcut!!! 🤗💗"
"I love capcut. It’s great! But..I kinda have a problem. Whenever I’m trying to use sounds from TikTok, it always says: “no internet. Please try again when connected to the internet” even when I am connected! Please fix this. Thank you <3"
"The application is good, but the storage space message makes people do not enter it often, because this message comes for no reason and that is the problem that people often fall into, please we hope to fix this problem..♥️"
"This is a great video editor app that I love using and it can like do everything, but when I tried to use the TikTok sounds feature and login with my TikTok it didn’t work and kept saying I had no favorite sounds even though I did. But other than that it’s a great app!"
Hello! Thanks for reading my review and personally I think it’s awesome bu there’s one problem I have with it. Instead of making custom sounds out of just videos can you make an option where you can use audio files that aren’t from iMusic? Thank you.
Seen this app is free it also has a lot of room to make videos it never ends! And also when I make videos it very helpful so I only use this app to edit because this app is very good and useful
"It’s very annoying that, whenever I’m trying to upload a video it says storage is full. Even though I cleared the cache many times, deleted my whole entire photo album, and even reinstalled the app! (MANY TIMES) 
Please fix this! (Or provide a solution to stop or prevent it!!)

-a fellow CapCut user"
"Overall, this is a pretty good app. Editing features, new animation effects, good quality, and a good app to learn how to edit with.

I'd say this is like a stage 2 editing app and Kinemaster is stage 1. 

This DEFINITELY needs a drawing feature. Glad I don't need to pay for anything, paying for stuff usually prevents me from learning how to edit and stuff. No bugs that I see, use this app daily to edit videos.

I like the fonts, animations, and all the stuff you can do on here. Not sure why people say its a bad editing software. 10/5 for sure."
"CapCut is such a great editing app! Weather you are making an edit or just adding text to a video, this is perfect. The only thing I really hope they add is a way to import our own and favorite fonts!"
"I have no problem with the app that is besides the fact that animating stickers is the most absurd thing, you think its simple, it only ever works on one sticker, the rest dont work when you press animate and chose an animation it works once then stops i cant figure it out and need help"
"Honestly, this app is very handy, i make my videos with this app, and its also very convenient to have. At first glance theres really nothing but once you explore more, the more options you have, the best part of it that everythings free, and that theres no watermark!"
So I have a new friend and he said he was my first sub so I wanted to make a memorie vid but it keeps saying insufficient storage. Clean up some phone storage and try again but I deleted a few videos that I don’t need but it keeps saying insufficient storage. Clean up some phone storage and try again. that I really don’t like when it says that
I like CapCut because your able to do things that other apps that you have to pay to use can’t and it’s free the bad thing is how long it takes to load the video to your camera roll and how when you go off the app it stops but overall it’s pretty good.
"Hi cap cut!, this app is AMAZING! But I have a small problem it’s the slow mo,if you made the slow mo smooth like video star, I’m sure it will be 5/5 stars, the slow mo needs a lot of effort because if you just wanted a edit with a smooth slow mo it would be perfect if it was smooth , but although I recommend this app!."
"The app has everything you need to do basic editing on your phone. iMovie for iPhone is nowhere near how good this app is, and it is 100% free, high quality results. I needed to come and leave a comment, they really deserve it for developing such a nice app."
This app gives me the ability to make much better content for people and makes me proud of the things I put out to the public. Go search and look up “Memes_for_the_boysss” on tiktok to see example
"Sikeee nothing is wrong with it and I really rec
 I’ve been trying to find a editing app then saw this one then downloaded it amd then deleted because i didn’t even know how to edit then I download it again and practice on editing then GoT better I LOVE This APP"
"This app is so great, it’s just that I have an iPhone 11 and when I take a screenshot it shows the full screen. If it does that I’ll have to crop it every time. So can you please add crops you can save and use over and over? Please that would help a lot."
Ok so I use CapCut to edit for my tiktoks which is really easy when I use this app but the thing is that when I wanna use the aura affect it doesn’t work and I don't see the affect idk if it’s a gitch or if it’s Bc I’m in an iPad but if u can plss fix it I’m trying to reload the app to see
"For a few months I’ve been very interested in editing. It took me SOOOOOO long to find and app that was easy to use, I tried apps that made edits for me but they never came out how I wanted them too. CapCut helped a lot! Thank you for making this app it’s the best!"
IT WAS AMAZING! had everything it had moving abilities to move your photo but there is one problem the it doesn’t work after a while you use it after a day or two because it doesn’t work it says that you have no Internet connection I’ve tried other apps and it works with Internet connection it is slow down my phone and taking up a lot of memory so that’s all I have to complain about.
It’s an amazing app I have a recommendation though It would be nice if you could favorite  effects or animations so for if you uses the same one in many of your edits you wouldn’t have to scroll through many animations or effects
"Okay first of all, everything is free, and second of all, it’s good stuff! It’s really good for editing. It’s pretty hard to use, but once you get use to it it’ll be easy. But anyways, if anyone is reading this then u should download this app. Keep up the good work! Have a good day/night ❤️"
"it’s an absolutely fantastic app with great effects and animations but it’s lacking a bit in the text and filter section. it would be great if there was a way to import your own fonts, and a way to upload your own luts/filters/coloring. I would definitely recommend this app though!"
I LOVE THE APP. But I just wish if you added options to edit the transitions so that we can move it a certain way. I also want to make them smooth. Sometimes it glitches but Over all it’s an amazing app. Keep updating it! :)
"Recently when I try to make a smooth slow motion on capcut and I reply the video it acts as if it wasn’t applied at all, and it’s kinda making me a bit upset. But the other option just generally gives me a headache looking at it :/ so please if anyone can help me please do"
So basically the make it smoother dose not work on me but other people I did not have technical difficulties on CapCut but I can’t tap on the make it smoother. Can you please fix that but I like the app for beginners it’s really good. :)
"Cap cut makes editing videos a breeze, the only thing I struggle with, or more so have a problem with is it always says “lost internet connection” when attempting to edit a video with TikTok sounds, unsure when they will address this and fix it."
"Ok I don’t know how many times I’ve reviewed this but THE UPDATE IS MAKING THE TEXT S.L.O.W! Like i adjust it to be faster it will most likely turn very laggy. And technically that’s not with just the text (it’s mostly with the text, but it’s not just the text) it’s with the effects and the text too. Pls fix this. 

Have a nice day! ❤️🌹"
"I love this app! It is so simple to make edits on it. It can be difficult to edit clips because the app often asks you to edit the transitions especially on shorter clips, otherwise a great app! I recommend it to anyone who wants to make videos!"
"Love this app a lot, been using it for a few years, but there’s just ONE thing that ticks me off:when I can’t cut the sound where I need it. I mean I can do it, but I can’t aline that specific part to my edit! It annoys me every time! I’ve gone full anger mode a lot because of this, please fix it!"
This app is bussin bussin but it is hard to tween on it. If you try to tween after moving the overlay a lot it kinda like moves bye it’s self when you try to! But overall CapCut is very good! :) there is velocity for you and most effects are amazing!
I make anime edits and this makes life so much easier! If you love to edit videos or make edits then this is the right app for you! Even if you just are sending an edited video to a friend you could edit the video with ease!! Five out of Five stars!
I lost cap cut bc my I phone 6 I had to back up some storage and I didn’t want to delete this at all I loved this so much but I had to and when I try do download it back it would let me do and I’m crying 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😔😔😔😔😔😔 please what should I do to get this cap cut back
"This is my honest opinion!!

CapCut is the best mobile editing app.
It’s easy to use, it’s free, and it has almost everything you need ! I’ve been using it for a while now, and I love it! 

The camera effects are great, the video effects are great, the filters are great, the settings are great, the only thing that isn’t great is the slomo!!

The slow mo is choppy and I have to use twixtor or vsco to slow down my videos. That’s the only thing about this app that I will complain about. They need better slowmos!"
The app is just amazing in general for editing but I have an idea than can change the way certain people edit… I think you should enable us to animate the masks or to be able to translate it to a certain point
"There’s this problem that happened once but it might happen again so fix it anyways if you could but anyways, there’s this problem where the overlay/text would move on it’s own, that’s all I have to say."
Hello I have been looking for apps and I’ve been using CapCut like forever and I  really want this explode effect and yes other wise you’re app is really good it dose not have anay crashes but sometimes I have to reaload my app to fix them anayway can you add more filters like ascetic ones thank you please write a comment back pls
"The app won’t let me import sounds into my videos for edits, it’s rlly annoying cause I cant do anything, I like to make Roblox edits. It was working when I first got the app, but when I came on a couple of day ago and it wouldn’t work. I deleted and re downloaded it but it didn’t work. So ya….thx."
I think CapCut is a very good editing app! However when I go to make a video it says “insufficient storage” and I delete a lot of things and it still says that. If you can improve that I’ll definitely like the app a whole lot more but other than that this app is great!
"CapCut is such a good app for beginners like me! CapCut is an amazing app for me and many others!
CapCut comes with so many pre-made effects unlike other apps. CapCut is so easy to figure out. The possibilities are endless!
I’d highly recommend this for everyone just learning to edit. 9/10!"
"Hello, I was trying to make an edit on this app as usual, but for some reason it keeps making it 30 minutes and 3 seconds long. I would really recommend you guys checking this out"
This app is great 100% amazing 🤩 I couldn’t say anything’s wrong but one thing.. ☝🏼it could use better effects. The animations great. But it shouldn’t be called that. Capcut should really add a real animation were you tap a button and you can make your edit animated!! Yes that’s it 😚😚
Hi if ur seeing this please add mores songs! I know u have a lot but there’s not a lot of songs with words . And if u add more can j add like the songs that are more recommended because it’s bugging me because I don’t make music videos because of this. Thank you please fix these have a good day/ night
"I love this app because it’s fully free, has no watermarks or ads, and is easy to use! I also really love the Auto-Captions feature as it saves so much time! The only thing I would suggest is having a dark mode for the home menu. Thanks! :)"
"I love CapCut, I use it everyday to make edits and it’s a very good app. One thing I would like to mention is that even if you have no projects or anything else it takes up so much storage, and I don’t know why and it’s very irritating.."
"I absolutely love this app! It’s simple to use, has lots of features, and everything turns out great! It’s so nice because while other apps might get slightly better results, they take forever and are very confusing to use *cough cough VideoStar cough*."
"There is nothing wrong with my phone storage at all I never get any notifications I even check and it says nothing is wrong but it keeps saying crap about my storage, this is getting very annoying I will delete this app and try and download it again to see if anything got fixed. NO nothing even worked and it won’t let me edit stuff. This app used to be so fun but now it keeps talking about problems that aren’t happening😑"
This app is so great and I love how you don’t have to pay to remove the water mark this app deserves more love because this app is AMAZING I highly recommend if you can’t use any editing app because you are broke and can’t pay for transitions pick this app it is such a good app!
This app has everything! It’s just needs a few more fire transitions and the Picture in Picture feature and it would be hands down the number one app on the AppStore.
The app is great I’ve been using it for quite awhile but until now the style option for photos isn’t popping up and I can’t do my edits so I don’t know if you guys can fix that. Have a good day/night.
"People are saying it is bad but it really isn't. It is completely free, and you can remove the watermark. Like I said, it is FREE. You downloaded a free app. Of course there is bugs. But it is an amazing app overall and I use it to edit all of my videos"
"It’s a great app that has made my life much easier, I would always end up downloading a bunch of random editing apps that would do the bare minimum. It’s simple to use, basically all the tools are free, and it does leave a watermark."
"I’m giving this app 2 stars due to the fact that i cannot add any audio i have recorded and saved from a voice memo app to my videos i make here because it is silent and i cannot hear the audio on playback. I used to use this app all the time to help me make my announcement videos but now i cannot 
Please fix this bug"
"I think this app is very well developed. One suggestion I have is to make it possible to manually delete the background, as sometimes it doesn’t work properly and crops the wrong thing. Thanks!"
This app makes me want to DIE it has good features and stuff but the slow Mo is always glitchy. i get that they fixed it but it won’t just happen for me. The templets SHOUKD be removed. NO ONE USES THEM well some people do but still. They are also very bad so PLS PLS PLS remove them. Take my review as a REASON to remove templates 😘
"I've been using this app for about two years and its a really good editing app, especially for beginners. Theres a lot that can be done with this app, but theres some problems about it.. 
1. The graphs arent working. 
I was trying to edit a video and zooming in and then putting graphs, but for some reason instead of zooming in, it just zooms out instead? 
2.
My projects keep getting deleted. 
Sometimes when I'm making a video, then close out the app (i saved the project btw) then when I go back on the app, my project is gone. 
3.
My templates keep getting corrupted."
"Hello my name is Michael and I am a user of cap cut, Now on to the point in the latest update the smoother slow motion is no working for me as when it is loading it loads fast until u get 50% then that’s when mines stops I’m not sure if anyone else is going through the same issue as me but ya I hope someone sees this and this Michael, have a good day and/or night."
"I am tired of using other apps! This editing app is the best I have used!
Other apps never work and too complicated, but in this one it is so easy I can create a video in less than two minutes!"
CapCut is amazing for beginners and you can do pretty much anything getting to start it can be a little confusing but other wise it’s a really good app I’m giving a 5 star I highly recommend and the best part is it’s free keep up the good 😊
I use to love this app and I gave it 5 stars but this recent update will not allow me to do anything it keeps asking to get permission to access my photo library and there is not option to do so. When I click the settings button it only shows me tabs that do not allow me to give the app access. So until this is fixed the app will receive a 1 star rating until I can use it again.
"Overall, CapCut is an amazing app! It has great potential! I really like the stickers and the effects. And, it doesn’t have a watermark. But, I wish you were able to add more layers since I am an animator. Other than that, there are not any other problems that occur while I use this app."
This is the best editing app I have used EVER! I 100% recommend it has soooo many options and all for FREE. I am a influencer on Tik Tok and I love that I can use my tik tok sounds on it! It comes with so many stickers and fonts and I think that this would be a great app for you to download
"Love the app. Just recently purchased a generation 6 iPad, due to lack of storage on phone. My only problem is there isn’t availability for 2/4k quality when Saving like their is on my iPhone. Is this due to my iPad being a few years old?"
"I really like this app because it has everything i needed in a editing app, Other editing apps I downloaded were just not for me. So i think you should download this app if you are looking for a editing app to use!!"
I love this app! It is perfect for making edits or memes or anything like that. It works 100% correctly but the TikTok audio picker or whatever it's called is not working. It keeps telling me I don't have my internet on even though I do. Can you please fix that? Thank you! 🤍
"Hi I’m just gonna say that this is my personal fave editing app ive ever used. My problem is: when I need more storage i have to delete stuff, so I did and it didn’t work so i threw away some pretty good content if you could fix that i would highly appreciate that. Thanks!"
Ive had this before with Kinemaster  so i switched to CapCut the Kinemaster issue got fixed randomly but no matter what i do i can’t get it to use photos or videos when i go into the privacy thingy in settings al it says is that any apps that request photo access will be there but CapCut isn’t there
Add a motion blur effect so the slow motion when i lower the speed looks more smooth and same thing when i make the speed high. or change a part of the velocity to make itnlook smooth during those moments
"The sound doesn’t work when extracted most of the time, I had to re-download the app. Even so, the audio isn’t working... Please resolve this issue CapCut. I’ll be deleting this and using another app. I would love if you could fix this weird glitch. Thank you. ❤️"
I made so many videos but then one day it stopped I deleted the app and reinstalled it but it still didn’t work I cried for a little bit because I made so many videos I loved and there gone
"It’s really great for editing, I use it a lot, but the thing is, it needs a lot of storage. I will make an edit, and it won’t let me save the edit, so I delete some stuff, but then it won’t even let me open the edit because I “don’t have enough storage. I have deleted a lot of good videos & photos just to save a small video."
"Honestly, this is a really good editing app. I would totally recommend it. Although, I do think that they should add a search bar to search for the animations. It becomes repetitive to always have to scroll though all the animations and find the one that you want to use"
I think there should be like a velocity edit option like basically you import audio then you select it and select the beat style and then the effects and then done!
As a person that has used CapCut for so long it was fun and easy but I stopped and switched because when you slow the speed down it’s so laggy and glitchy so please try to fix the slow motion;)
"I really enjoy this app, it’s super easy to use and there’s no watermark! the end does have something that says “capcut” but you can delete that from your video, the animations are also very easy to use! I’ve tried using other apps like Video Star and it was very confusing. Also CapCut is free!"
"One of the best editing apps out there, I just started editing and this makes it so easy and fun! Practically everything is free and I learned how to use it all by myself, not complicated at all. I’m always satisfied with the product too! :)"
"This app is just awesome. I love to edit but never found a good app to use! When l found CapCut l decided to try it. 

I was blown away. The transitions are smooth and super pretty, you can add your own audio, pictures etc. I recommend this app 100%. Trust me, you’ll be satisfied."
I like to edit a lot and this is by far my favorite app to edit it’s free and it has no watermark but it would be nice if maybe we can make are own transitions? Just a suggestion 🤗 but this is the best free editing app I 100% recommend . Have a nice day / night 💃🏻
This app is so handy and neat I love it so much it has so much to discover and surprises lol I did I vid in capcut and I got on it 12M likes omg can u BELIVE it?!?!???!!! This app is the best like seriously u must use it it’s the best and editing and it tells u where are the stuff as I said sooo handy I love this app so so so so so so so so so muchhhh I use it DÂILY cause I love it 😍😍😇😇😌😌😌😌
This app is amazing without hidden subscription requirements. It’s very easy and intuitive to use! It has everything I need to make cute small videos for my social media. I would recommend this for everyone.
"Ok, I have been looking for this app FOREVER now! I needed an app that could turn a videos audio into audio and do great transitions, well I found a pile of shiny gold! I haven’t been using the app for too long but this is by far the best one I have used!"
"the app is great better than most apps and easy to use. its free and its amazing. i have 2  of recommendations so i thought of writing them here!
1:more animations for videos and text
2:fix frozen glitch; the video slows down and it freezes."
"It’s a great app and the animations are awesome. But my phone begins to overheat whenever I play the video and I have to continue replaying the video to make a sure things are even, however it just makes my phone hot. I’m not sure if that’s my phone but I recently got this phone so I’m not sure"
"So I love the smooth option for it, it really looks good but when you put it on some clips there’s a green light on it that will flash and it ruins the edit, and the smooth option and slow motion is a bit buggy, please fix it thank you."
"Maybe add a puppet feature? Like for example, you have a picture of a video game character, and the feature would allow you to move any of the body parts."
"I really enjoy CapCut! It’s easy to edit, and you and everything is free! Also, I really like how when you publish it, it doesn’t have a watermark! I really like editing on CapCut. It’s one of the best editing apps I have ever experienced. Thank you dearly. If I could rate CapCut 100, I would! Best. App. Ever!"
I’m in love with this app it is a easy to use free editor with great effects and is add free would definitely recommend if your new to editing or have been editing for a long time it has honestly made my videos look 10x better
"I haven’t experienced all the features yet. BUT DAM it’s awesome, and I have like 6 different video editor apps. This is one of the best so far. Only give it a four, since I haven’t experienced it very much yet, I’ll give 5 starts later once I fully understand it."
"For some reason my CapCut is always showing I have no internet connection, even though I do. And I have tired fixing it and nothing has worked. I have re downloaded the app, updated and everything to try to fix it and it still won’t let me."
"Almost all the time a I make videos on CapCut, when it says I have to much videos and or pictures I delete the photos and the videos until I don’t see any. Once I have ZERO videos and photos capcut just says I STILL don’t have enough storage, I delete my capcut videos, STILL NO STORAGE! I mean I love capcut but I think that it either is my iPad or the app."
Overall I love everything about this app it’s just that capcut needs to read their customers reviews and fix bugs or make updates (sorry for bad English)
"This app has pretty much anything a content creator would need but i have noticed a strange bug in the app… i dont know if its just me or its the app but for some reason when i go to upload a photo into a project it shows none of my photos please get back to me and respond
- Sincerely, Brady Guthrie"
"i love this app so much, and i have been using it for a while, but there are a few things i’d like, for example, a fricking drop shadow. it seriously can’t be that hard, just a shadow  on overlays. i downloaded vs (video star) just for the shadow, only to realize they make you PAY FOR MULTIPLE LAYERS????!!! ok yeah um add the drop shadow and i’ll be happy 😅"
"It’s a good app and all but the only thing you guys need to fix is the glitching part, when you cut and edit, it does this slow glitch thing. It would be a 5/5 if it wasn’t so glitchy. Everyone it’s a good app, a free one to, but they have a fix a few things."
"This app is amazing perfect quality and good for editors. I was a bad editor until i came across this amazing app. Very good i need to update it so i can have the smooth quality on the bottom, please help! Although amazing."
This app is so amazing they just recently added auto velocity edit. In one click you can have a whole velocity!!!!!! This is by far my favorite part. It does take a bit of time to get used to the app but it is really cool.
This app is so Good it’s easy to edit on here you don’t have to pay for hardly anything they have dope effects exportation is super easy and it doesn’t have a big fat water mark covering the screen when you export. Get this app!
"I got this back in like march around there it was a little hard at first but I started actually trying and it ended up being one of my favorite editing app I’ve had, I recommend this app"
"This app is so easy to understand
All of my friends and I use this app
The effects are great and the songs are just spot on
I recommend this app if your starting or if your already good at editing
It is the best 😁"
"I really love this app. The editing effects are great and stuff, but I have a suggestion for the audio or video. I was hoping maybe you could add a reverb affect. There can be different kinds. I rate this app a 10/10 anyway"
"I was using it right- so after a long while it said I didn’t have storage so I fixed it and then it says: Capcut requires access to the album for editing and saving videos. So I click confirm and it goes to settings and there is literally no button to give it access, I cant use the app now, please fix this!!"
I love this app. It’s really easy to use and it’s free unlike some other editing apps. It doesn’t put a watermark like funimate does and you can save it to your device for free as well. My favorite editing software you should really download it :))
Everything is great and I love the transitions but for some reason I can’t see certain effects and transitions other people can see I’m really confused and I have been trying to use certain ones but they never show up even if my CapCut is up to date
"Okk the good things I like about this app is that there stuff u do not have to pay for and there’s  multiple  ways/things uu can do to design ur edit, a few things I don’t like is that we have the same effects for a long time and this app run out of storage to much it would very much better if uu guys give us more space!!"
I have really no Complaints and there is one thing it gets super laggy if i edit for a while but other than that there is really nothing wrong with this app and i hope you can fox that minor issue
I mean it’s okay it’s just I am having a problem with whenever im importing a photo. After I exit the project or insert one ( I don’t really know this glitch is confusing) I can’t insert another photo and Half the thing I need to do on here is insert photos and this glitch really isn’t helping so 4 out of 5
So I make gacha videos and edits and I deleted kinemaster and switched to CapCut and all I have to say is that I am so happy I did. I love CapCut because it gives many options. If you are thinking of downloading this app you really should.  Thanks for your time reader
This app is great! I’ve been using it to make edits and it’s very easy to learn and use! One thing I’m hoping you guys add is graphs between key frames! It would really help a lot of people with smooth videos :D Also more transitions and possibly the ability to make our own?? Thanks!
The only reason why i give capcut 4 stars is because i would really like a graph for keyframes it would be really useful when putting my own little details in the edit. So far i have no complains about the app its my number one app to edit videos!
I love CapCut and use it for my Tik toks everyday! But I have ran into a few problems... there is a max overlay..? Take a moment to think about how STUPID that is. I was working on something abd I need more overlays and now I have to start all over. It’s kinda frustrating. Overall though the app is pretty good and underrated.
"I have a HP account where I make edits, and this app is perfect! I can’t recommend it more. My only issues is sometimes the chromakey tool in overlays is a little glitchy, and I wish there was a way to favorite or mass apply animations to save time."
So the app works fine it’s just that for the past 2 weeks I for some reason can’t put text or a overlay. I can click things like the canvas or audio button but just not those 2. I’ve done everything to but nothing works.
"Don’t get me wrong this app is PERFECT but I have some suggestions that could make it better.

- Make it available on PCs 
- More tools for the chrome key effect so we can adjust the green screen and not get the fuzzy stuff.
- More filters or color correction 
- Fix the volume problem where when we lower it down it barely goes down
- Audio effects 
- Import audio or video from other apps like google drive and documents

I hope you guys take my suggestions and thank you for an amazing app"
"I’m a Chinese living abroad and I’m only able to download this international version of the app, which does’t have the option of generating auto-captions for Chinese like the Mainland China version. It always takes FOREVER to manually input the captions. Please add this function to the international version to make it more user friendly for Chinese overseas!!!!!"
"I really love this app when it works for me but this has happened multiple times where I’ve had to delete a lot of a photos. For some reason it says I cannot make a video because I have no storage, I deleted all the photos I could but still no luck. Please fix this if this is happening to anyone else."
"I tend to use this app quite a bit but as of lately, when I export the video the video is a little off sync with the audio. The video in the player looks fine but when I save it, it is off and does not look good. Pls fix."
"Hello, I'll give a 5 stars but the thing is about this idea that the key frames, even though it's at low or high space it goes slower than I thought it was, I think you can update that a little bit more, thank you!"
The best you can get on iOS! I only have one request is that there should be a green screen function with the overlay. I have been looking for an app that works this good for a while and its free! I would recommend this app to anyone who does any kind of editing.
Because it is soooo helpful this is the first editing soft ware i used and it’s easy and simple one time I needed to make a vid with ALOT of green screens but it took me just one second and the video turned out perfectly.
"I’ve been using CapCut for 6 months now and I’ve been getting better . I’ve been really using Auto Velocity on Style but recently I haven’t found Style on my screen . I tried closing the app and opening it to see if that works but no it doesn’t .  

Can you guys help me with this situation ,please ?"
wonderful app 10:10 on everything except it sometimes tells me i dont have enough storage (i do tho!!!!) and it wont let me import my videos for some reason :( i usually just restart my phone and itll work but it hasnt been. i really dont wanna switch app this is such a fun and easy app but its making it hard. PLEASE FIX THIS!!!
"This app is amazing! Everything about it is very helpful for beginners but there is this glitch that always happens to me and its very annoying, Its with the scale, I slightly zoom in and it zooms in all the way in, and if I slightly move the scale it starts over again and its very annoying But other than that this is a very good app!"
"I have deleted almost every app in my phone and deleted almost every photo I have, but it still says insufficient storage when I try to download a 35 second video. Idk if this is a big but is very annoying. Please fix this."
This app is amazing I love it so much and I do my edits on cap cut and I think I’ve had cap cut for maybe for like a year or two and I’ve gotten better at my edit’s from when I first started editing but go download cap cut this app is wonderful!!’
"this app is good when it comes to simple edits but if theres one thing that i think lots of people would LOVE to have is smooth slow motion and/or a velocity effect or something velocity related, as well as some good quality too! other than that, this app is great👍🏽"
This is a good editing app for beginners and it is free most editing apps ask you to pay money for certain affects when you can just download Cap cut cause it gives you what other apps make you pay for but for free
I love this app but after a while of using it it won’t let me change the opacity of the text I put am not sure if that makes sense but it won’t let me change it and it’s really bugging me and I don’t know what to do about it please help or try to fix it:/
"So I love using capcut to edit my videos but now when I pressed make new project it didn’t let me capcut is the easiest thing I use to edit my videos please fix this pls!😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

P.S fix this or I will find where you live and destroy you👿😈👺"
"Ok overall, I love this game; but there’s one big weird bug that must be fixed. When you download and go to graphs, there’s a big text that you can’t get rid off and it says “Use Graphs to customize transitions between key frames” You can’t tap on any graph mechanics. Please fix it"
"So I was opening capcut, and it said “capcut needs access” but in setting it only has siri. It’s been 20 minutes and still. I need to post on stuff but even those apps don’t work. Or can someone help me?"
I give it four because I think that the app couldn’t use an update and the tutorial to I see many people who use the app and have much better edits than me and I don’t know how because it’s not in the tutorial but otherwise it’s is the best free editing app
The only thing I wish for is to be able to import the same pictures without having to leave the media option-
"Honestly I love it, I used many edit apps and they weren’t good. It’s easy to use and it’s cool I have just 1 complaint, you need internet to edit anything, but other then that, I love this app so much🤍💕I totally recommend it!"
"This is a very great app for me to edit videos for many things! It has no watermark for me for free! I love it as much, I will be able to edit more things than ever! I suggest downloading it! It has cute stickers too! This also helps with my intro!"
"I love this app I have been using it for a while and I have almost mastered this app but I would like there to be a little more advanced stuff added to capcut like more advanced transitions,animations and effects possibly? If that is a thing :)"
"In my opinion, Capcut is the best beginner app, there is many presets for those who don’t know how to use keyframes. You can do so much with this app I definitely recommend this for starters, This is my only editing app I use so I recommend getting this app!"
Short cus me lazy really easy to use I love making Gacha club videos I love the effects and music you can use i like making videos of me and my friends although it would be nice if you could add texts to a video otherwise I love it
When ever I have storage I always have to delete photos when it works on other apps so please if there’s anyway you can help or do anything please let me know
you can use it for like edit for everything you’re not like eating what’s not on your phone it’s food and like waking up you can’t do that on CapCut so I’m not talking about like everything everything and yeah it’s really awesome
"This app has upped my game in everything internet related.

-no watermark
-no premium version
-generally good effects
-very well made
-easy to use
-OVERLAYS :)
-movable overlays!
-so many audio options
-extractable audio

This is a great app! I wish you could tween in it, but overall it’s wonderful! It’s was obviously worked very hard on and isn’t just a cash grab. Best editing app I’ve ever downloaded.

Edit: so if discovers that when I escort things the audio is off timing. This is pretty annoying, but tbh it doesn’t ruin the app for me :)"
"I love CapCut so much it’s an amazing editing app, it has so many filters and things you can do on it. I think the only bad thing about this app is that it can get really slow sometimes. I really think that CapCut deserves 5 stars."
Don’t get me wrong this app is perfect but the problems for me are that sometimes when I open up my edit and press play to review what I just did it skips everything and shows some clips of what I did and Aldo before I can start my project it says my storage is full even tho cap cut is the only app I have so that’s what really triggers me please find a way to stop these ridiculous glitches
This has been one of the best editing apps I have ever had for iOS. But every once and a while a video I try editing just breaks and won’t work with anything. It also takes up way to much space.
So I downloaded video star I thought it’s very good for editing it wasn’t then I asked my friends what app is good for editing they told me capcut I didn’t believe them at first but it’s actually worked out and it’s very good for editing thank you so much.<3
I love this app for editing it’s easy and simple but I’ve been having some glitches where it glitches when I moving frame to frame and I can can’t edit like that because I can’t get the perfect beat drop when I can’t see on which frame to do it pls fix the bugs that the app is having please and thanks 🤝
"I love everything about this app, I love how every asset and feature is free. One idea though, for the animations, let us be able to make our own combos instead of the preset ones we already have, if you add this, then the app will be perfect"
It’s so good and it has soooo much and it doesn’t have the little premium which I like because I feel like we should have a lot and it is so cool how the editing is in this app so I would definitely pick this one over any else one
Ok so I wanted to make a video for gacha and when I went to go create a new project it said I need access to the album and I have 10 other projects and nothing shows up in settings. I’m really confused and it would really help if you could explain it to me.
"This app is the best editing app I have used. I also love that everything is free, you usually need to pay for most of the other editing apps to get special effects, advantages, etc. That is why I really like this app."
It’s so good <3 at the current state I’ve used it for weeks and it has not once asked for my money in fact I’m not sure if you have to pay for anything at all! Best on the market! I am so greatly pleased.
I love this app but I’m curious of why the auto velocity effect isn’t popping up for me even after I updated can you please respond because I don’t wanna delete and download it back and lose my data
"I love this app: it helps me cut vids together. I DO wish that it had more effect sounds, but overall, amazing. My brother and my sis ask me to put vids of their games and activities into a cool video and with this app, I can do that. I can even put pics of memes like the emotional damage meme into my videos."
"This is app is nice and a genuinely good for editing, but the thing is that it told me, “Cant make video because you have insufficient storage” or something. I delete like a hundred or so pics and videos, but nothing happened. Is it something wrong with me or the app?? 

-confused"
So basically I saw this TikTok that there was a new feature on CapCut that was named “light dynamic “ or however you call it. So I went to see if it was there and no it wasn’t and then I tried update it and I pressed style and I was still wasn’t there and I’m so confused? Why isn’t it there a bunch people said to update it but it isn’t there?
When I get home from school and I’m not going back home I’m just trying not sleep until tomorrow morning I can go to eat later I have a lot to eat and I’m just trying my hardest and I’m just going back home and I can’t eat my bad lol I just woke my heart lol lol I’m not doing it now I’m going back to bed now I’m going back to bed lol I just woke you I love love you for too long I hope you are ok I can’t sleep well I woke up and woke woke up this morning woke woke up and I got up to die lol
It’s a great app I love using it to edit but how come it says no internet when I have internet. It gets annoying I would have to uninstall the app and reinstall it just to get it to work again and even the give it a few days and it’s back at it again with the no internet crap. Why is that???
It is the best thing ever it took me some time to learn how the app specifically worked but after I did it was great. I had issues with uploading audios but then I figured it out. Overall this app has been great and captured great memories!
At first i was a little skeptical because i have never edited anything but i got reasonably better and better until I felt like it was an everyday thing thank you for capcut it is amazing
I’ve been having this app for a long time but as soon I made more videos  it said MY STORAGE WAS FULL! So I had to clean up my storage so when I came back to the app it still said that I had to clean up my storage!
"capcut is by far my all time favorite editing app for sure. it’s fairly easy to navigate, which is super handy for me. my favorite feature is extracting audio from a video file in your galary, which is so useful. i think i’ve used khinemaster, imovie, and capcut. capcut is definitely my first choice for sure. i’m not sure i have any complaints for the app, saying it’s got pretty much all i need. i’m so glad i switched to capcut! especially sense it’s free and you don’t have an annoying water mark."
"I love the app all I came here for is to suggest something, a movement tracker!!! Like when a person or oc moves the screen or whatever will move along with it!!! It makes things smoother! Also motion blur ! That’ll help a lot with edits or Gacha videos !"
"Hi so I love CapCut and its my only editing app. But can you please add keyframes. Because most apps that include keyframes are too expensive and if you don’t mind, please make it free. Also, Please make the speed thing smoother and to get better quality. Thank you so much!"
"I don't necessarily find this a problem but genuinely it bothers me a little, i have an iphone 11 and every time i try to swipe the opacity bar i end up swiping to another app and it gets annoying maybe if y'all were to raise it a bit or do something with it?"
So I was bored wanting to edit something and I did but it say my storage is full but I just cleaned it  pls fix this it’s not fair to me and pls fix this glitch also I was gunna edit a vid Imma make in roblox if u don’t know what roblox is search it it’s a game where u play with ur friends and make cool avatars but I liked 2017 style.. but whatever pls fix this !!
This app is the best editing app I have ever seen it’s free and amazing. I usually used KineMaster but it got annoying because all the adds saying get out subscription and when I do the edits they wipe out all of my progress so I’m so glad I came across this app is is the best.
"I just started editing, and it’s so fun using this app. It’s give me something to do when I’m at home. CapCut is a super good app to use. It’s has really good images and effects. This app is really good and everyone should get it if they want to learn how to edit. ❤️"
"Every time I wanna download my videos it says “This is too much storage for your phone, please try and cleaning up” Like- I deleted all my game apps just to download my videos and that does not help. So I have to delete my edits that I did, witch was sad bc it Took so long to do my edits. Yet, I had to delete for A dam video that has A FANCAM LIKE JUST A FANCAM. Please CapCut fix it!! Overall it’s pretty nice"
The app its really good! But make the keyframes more like moveable and add graphs. Its really easy to use! But like try to make it a bit more hard i been using capcut for 1/2 years but i havent been able to be like other editors like have graphs.
"Not gonna lie, this is probably the best video/picture editing app I have ever used. I tried KineMaster, but it was too complicated. I used VLLO for a while, but it took up too much storage. This app is just perfect for pros and beginners, I highly recommend it. ❤️"
"This app is so poggers! I love it! No watermark which makes my life easier, And the transitions aren’t crappy at all! I was finally able to do the sugar crash trend, but it’s dead 💀 I would Probably recommend CapCut to smaller youtubers who like making edits! My new fav editing app ❤️💖"
"when i try to make a new project it tells me i don’t have enough storage. i deleted over 2,000 photos and videos from my device and it still says that. i checked my storage and i have barley used any. when i got it to work it was amazing but after that it stoped working again"
It’s a great app for editing but it uses a lot of data and space which I hate a lot because I had to delete a lot of pictures so I think that needs help but overall it’s pretty great for edits and there’s no water marks but please work with the space and data problem
"everything is great with this app and I love the no water marks and that it is 100% free, though I do have some suggestions: add graphs! graphs help edits be smoother and less choppy. add coloring! coloring is to color photos/videos. that’s all I have to suggest right now!"
"I’ve waited for such a long time looking for a video editing app where the user interface was easy to use, super quick and clean. I’ve literally shared and recommended to so many of my friends I love it... rly fast way for editing TikTok’s"
I love this app ever since I first had it it has helped me so much and before I even started using vs this is what would help me sharpen my clips add some masking and multiple layers for when I had vsf and the blending helps so much this is the best experience <3
"The fact that this is free and works just as well as the paid editing apps is amazing! You see, I’m a minor who doesn’t have a job and my parents will never pay for editing apps. So this is a blessing on the earth!"
"I LOVE this app , there is no watermark , everything is completely free and easy to use , I am just having trouble with the audio , when I try to extract one it make me wait a lot and then it doesn’t get the audio , so if you can please fix this it will be awesome."
"Ok first this is the best editing app in the whole world, now time for the suggestions So when I’m editing my thing glitches a lot the video will stay at one part of it and wont move. But great app."
I would give this amazing editing app a five star but I wish there was some other added features and effects but that isn’t their fault. However this is an amazing editing app that doesn’t even have a watermark! I now use this app for most of my edits.
"I LOVE this app so much, it teaches me so much. Something that would be nice would be a folder I could put my edits into that are easy to get to and if I need to move edits around to different folders it would be much easier and help me stay organized!"
"CapCut has wonderful effects and filters. I saw a lot of TikTok users use this app. The effects and animations are 100% free. Other editing apps have price on effects and animation, but CapCut is total free. Try this app and you’ll wanna keep it! I have a TikTok and I use this app for editing! Thanks, CapCut"
This app is that really wonderful app it’s really good for editing vids they are also like better than Funimate no hate you could even put someone’s add it on top of yours or something like that LOL- I know that doesn’t make sense but something like that
I really wanted to do an edit with the volocity thing and I couldn’t find the Style button. I searched up many options instead of using a VPN. I tried and all of them didn’t work. Can you please fix this?
I personally think that this app is amazing! There’s no watermark and there’s lots of really good transitions and effects! I think that this is the best free app for edits and more b I just think that you should be able to tween but overall this app is the best I’ve ever had 😁
This app is such a good use if your all about editing videos AND photos! I use this so much and it helps a lot! One of the best things about this app is that all the effects are free! I would recommend this app to people that absolutely ENJOY and LOVE editing!
So.. I have an issue where I like using bling effects and I hate watermarks and I was using kinemaster premium... I found this and it has so many effects and text ideas no watermark no premium or anything !!!
"Whenever I try to use the bling effect it says that I have no internet connection. Is there anyway to fix this? Other than that this app is phenomenal, the only app I use to edit my videos!"
"THIS APP IS INCREDIBLE!!! nothing cost money and it works like a dream, this is way less time consuming than video star, I highly recommend this, I have made edits so easily and better than ever on this app, 4.5 stars is underrated"
"i’ve had this app for years, yes years. Maybe around two. it’s such a great app if you know how to use it and i must say it’s very easy to learn how. great edits have came out of this. thank you for making this app !"
"I really like capcut and I like using it for edits but for some reason the reverse button doesn’t work, it used to work but now it doesn’t?? I already redownloaded it already and it still doesn’t work. I hope y’all can fix it."
"Hey CapCut I have a question for you guys..why did y’all remove the velocity thing this made your app more popular and now we have to make it our selves and this is gonna make your app mostly become unpopular,so I probably recommend potting the velocity effect back pls and thank you have a nice day :)"
This app os so easy to use. I would recommend for editing beginners. The only downfall it has is on some phones the updates are slow getting to you I still don’t have some things other people have otherwise this app is amazing!!!
"well first of it takes up a whole lot of storage and some times lags, other wise the app is good for beginners pretty easy to use. And they come out with good updates which im looking forward for the future ones."
"First of all, I love this app, but there is one huge problem with it. When I connect my TikTok account for the audios, it will not show any of the recent audios I have favorited. I have redownloaded the app multiple times and still nothing has worked. PLEASE FIX!"
You know when you zoom in to certain parts of the video. Sense the update that feature is glitching out
"everytime i try to go on capcut it always says “Insufficient storage” 👎 so i go over to my setting and managed my storage until i have **2 FRICKING GIGABYTES** 😭😭 and it still says insufficient storage 😓😓 left so i go over to my photos and DELETE 😩😩every single of my 10,000 photos until i finally have 1 **gigabyte** left 😓😓

it still says insufficent storage flip this thing im uninstalling this rip my photos"
I love the app easy to use got a lot of features but my option to add tiktok sounds stopped working after one day with the message “no internet connection try again later” and it’s been a month or so and it’s still not working
so problem number 1:VIDEO TOO SHORT I DONT WANT TO CHANGE IT I WANT TO CHANGE SPEED number 2:the literal cut button I always press the video and it won’t make me change speed I took 2 hours changing it problem number 3:the video button it never works but that’s all I had to say for 3 but please fix those bugs
I used this app to make my first edit and it turned out nice and didn’t take me too long to learn. it’s not too fancy but it has everything you need without a price. don’t change pls ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
CapCut is amazing! I love this app so much and edits look so good afterwards. CapCut had a issue for to where I could only insert pictures videos and add text. I could not do anything else but gladly I’m trying to fix it with an update. If it does not work I hope it will later but overall it’s a great app!
"So I accidentally deleted Capcut and I had like 45+ edits on there!! Is there any way I could retrieve them all? On the other hand, Capcut is a very very good app! I use it for all my edits and it’s pretty simple to use. If there’s any way to retrieve my edits, please tell me. Thank you!"
"I love the game its fun to use since i know how to edit but… one day It said “CapCut requires to the album editing and saving videos” i press confirm and takes me to my settings  and doesn't show me where to go! Please help.. :( i just wanted to edit a video for a friend for her birthday her birthday was 3 days ago i feel really bad! 
So please help where do i go!"
"I love how many options their are when you edit your videos, however when it says “insignificant storage” I delete at least 6 videos that I loved, but it still says “insignificant storage” which I am not pleased about."
Ok I love this app so much but I think there could be a few tweaks to it. One I feel like the max overlays should be like 12 instead because I was doing rlly well and then it said max overlays•-• two maybe more filter options
"The app itself is amazing. I use is almost everyday to edit my videos. But when I add the same video I already added, it changes. For example, I import a video, and I adjust the video and import it again. The first time I imported it, it changes to the clip I adjusted which I HATE."
"This app is a really good app, o really enjoy making velocity edits on here and others types to... and I don’t want to sound rude but what really annoys me is that it keeps telling me that I don’t have enough storage even though I deleted so many apps, pictures, and drafts just so I can save the video"
"Good for editing… when the app wants to work. Sometimes when I pick what photos/videos to use it says it couldn’t load it. And I try many things to make it work— starting a new project, reopening the app, resetting my phone and opening the app again— but nothing works. Haven’t been able to edit for a while now and decided to write this review."
THIS APP IS AMAZING LIKE OMG.. but i have a question! Can you guys please add the ghost affect. The same one they have on video star. Iam trying to make an edit and i really need that affect. Oh and add more transitions and more keyframes! Other than that the app is amazing. I havent had any trouble with it
"It’s a great app to edit with, over all I would suggest for anyone to use it! I would though suggest that it would be made a bit easier, when I’m editing my videos all the buttons are scattered out so it’s a bit hard to find. I love the app overall! 💕"
I think this app is perfect for beginner editors like my self but I encountered some problems while editing like every time I try to export a video and it almost gets there it says a problem occured and I didn’t do anything and I have tried everything to fix this problem that is the only complaint I have
"I am giving it a low rating. Honestly, so basically I was in the middle of editing and it froze. I was upset, as usual, so I existed out of the app. And the I opened the app and tried to enter the edit I was doing. It said insufficient storage, so I checked my storage. It said I had barley used any storage. So I deleted the videos. Still said I didn’t have enough storage, so I deleted the app. I wish I was joking. 
Idk if it’s a bug. But fix it pls. Overall it’s a OK app but sometimes confusing."
So I Was Watching Gacha Movies In 2018 i Think And At The Ending It Says CapCut So I Decided Lemme Try Dis App! And It was really easy to use i was gonna make a channel but i wanna do it in the future And i rate this 10/10 Bc It Made My Dream Come True And I Honestly Think You Should Download It 🙂
"I just downloaded this game and edited a few videos, I really enjoyed the app until I tried to use the features and it said I wasn’t connected to the internet, which is weird because my internet was working just fine. I restarted the app(didn’t work) I deleted the app and reinstalled it (didn’t work) and it’s still not working. I don’t know if this is happening to others but this error is really ruining the app for me."
The fact that everything is free in this app and no ads I recommend the app most editing apps have a lot of ads and you need to pay for most of the app I have nearly had this app for 1 year it’s such a great app
I love this mobile editing software because it 1 has no watermark 2 the ending is optional and 3 it doesn’t force you to pay to do certain things. I love this app and will continue to use it for a long time. Thank you.
Capcut is a really good app it’s free and easy to use.I’ve been getting used to some glitches lol.I recommend this app very much and I also post my edits I do here and a lot of people like the edits and ask me whats the app.I love this app 100% recommend ❤️❤️
"Honestly I’ve been through tons of editing apps and all of them have a catch, are bad, glitchy, annoying but not this one. This one is all you’ll ever need and it is super reliable. They deserve 5 stars."
"I am genuinely surprised this app doesn’t cost any money. All the tools on here make my videos look so professional! It’s very easy to use, and I would recommend this app for beginners. Don’t waste your time downloading iMovie, splice, videoleap, or pocket video. Get this app right here.... ahaha.. now.."
"I was a CapCut editor for about 3 months now. It helped me develop over time, even though I’m an after effects editor now, I still continue to use this editing app!"
I have no idea why I cannot use speed curve I looked everywhere I could and no one seemed to have this problem I am unsure of how this is happening and why but I need some advice on what to do.
"I love the app but can you add auto velocity again one day I tried to do an edit but I couldn’t find the auto velocity, please add it back Because now it’s really annoying to make all of the beats and stuff"
"Yo I got a question, did you guys delete the style button when you click on the photo/video because I was editing a video and I couldn’t find the style button—"
"i really love this app, it’s easy to use and it’s great for beginner editors or for people that don’t have the money to buy the expensive editing apps, but i just have one question. is there a way that you can make it to where camera focus 2 fades quicker? it still lasts a long time when i put the speed up to 100 and doesn’t fade as quickly as i’d like it to. i’d just like it if it could fade really fast, if not it’s fine, i just won’t use the blur anymore, but i’d really like it if the camera focus 2 faded faster, thanks!"
"This probably isn’t it’s intended purpose as an app, but it really does help you make gameplay montages.

I just made one and it looks great!
Just a little more practice and they’d look even better."
I love the app I make so much roblox edits but could you add a mirror affect other then that I love the app I can make so much roblox edits and the edits are so cool and it’s so easy to make the roblox edits on this app it’s not so long like the other apps I honestly love this all it’s amazing!!
"I love CapCut it’s a very good app and everything was running smoothly until it kept saying my internet wasn’t connected and i knew my internet was connected and it just made me angry, so if you could please fix this? Thanks"
As a beginner editor I find it just easy to work with. Honestly Capcut is the best editing app. I’ve tried so many other…this one was the BEST!! I recommend this for anyone who likes making edits for social media or for fun!! Ty Capcut. (Hope this helps)
"I love capcut and its easy to learn unlike alight or anything else. but the thing abt alight is they have more effects, they have graphs, and smooth slow-mo. Also much more. Im sure alot of ppl would use capcut more if u added stuff alight has but capcut is still a great app either way"
"This is honestly an amazing app, it has so many features! But I have a few suggestions! So for the effect transitions maybe add a cloud one! And for the animations, you can like do effects for it! Overall, it’s amazing I love everything!"
"Let’s you edit with no watermark! You don’t even need a premium! No ads, and there is a video clip at end that say CapCut, but you can even remove that for free! My favorite editing app and maybe app in general on my phone. 🥰"
"This app is…great! I love to make edits on here and show my family! Although my 4th edit ALMOST became a abomination! Nothing wrong with it though! I  recommend this app if you are a Gacha-tuber, they would get tons and tons of good comments I bet!"
"this app is so good, i cant explain how amazing it is. it provides many transitions to use for edits and they all make the edits pop out. this app is also perfect for beginners. if they are starting to edit, i recommend this app for them."
"So, When I started capcut I thought it was incredible. I thought “Wow, This is a good app!” But now , I think its a bit annoying. Whenever I have storage or free up, It still gives me a nofication of “Free up storage” Or something like that. And to today. Its fr*cking irritating, It restarted everything! I was also making a edit. This isnt bad, But it aint good for sure."
Hello! So this is gonna be really short I think this app is overall good but when it comes now to removing a background From a overlay image and video it cuts out things I don’t want cut out and I can’t fix/restore the things I want in said video or image..
"This app initially appears very useable, but has a number of issues regarding using with the iPhone.  Don’t download this and then make a video and try to download it.  It won’t:

Download into iMovie.  

Download into iCloud (if you have an account)

It appears to download, but if you go to find it under the name you gave your video, or the numerical strings CapCut gives it, it can’t be found.  

Apple will not help as it is a third-party application even though it is apparently trying to download into their (latest) iOS.   They say it is something about the application (bad coding?) that is the problem.  

If this can be fixed I am happy to re-review the product.  Meanwhile beware if you are using an iPhone."
"love this app at first i didnt know what to do but i  found out some ideas and got better and better this app literally saved my life you can do keyframes for edits on here do any kinds of transitions and flickers , watermarks, basically anything"
I love this app it’s free and awesome for new editors. overlays are the best and cropping videos. You might have some trouble with lagging but just refresh and it should be fine. Also this app is free with no watermark/ you can delete it for FREE. quick edits and long work awesome!
"I rated CapCut 1 star because you cannot Mel the transitions yourself unlike Alight Motion, if you are a beginner at editing and you want fro try an app to make smoother edits I recommend every other editing apps because of that reason, there are no graphs to make it smoother, the key frames are weird to use, and the transitions are mid. I have been editing for 3 years so I recommend that you take my advice and use other apps but not this one."
Ok I saw my sis make a vid and it turn out well but wan I do it it turn out very bad for me bc I have a yt channel and I make gaming vids and when I got finished play my game and pressing the app and it said that I can not make a vids out of my photo vids like it is soo bad I fell I wast my time make a vid for my yt channel like it took like 20 or 25 minutes to make it it was a wast of time for me plz fix this I beg you
The app over all works perfectly fine but on my iphone when i had the app it would make my phone crash and over heat and power off like all the time that’s my only issue other than that i totally recommend!!
"First of all I love the app so much, and it can be used for fan edits, velocities, and Roblox edits, etc. However I don’t like how you can’t do your in transitions and only have presets. I would love if you guys would let people make their own transitions and add graphs. Thank you."
This app is amazing! It is very simple to use and is great for beginners as well! I see nothing wrong with this app! I hope you guys also get to enjoy this app as much as I do! It’s like every single other editing app I use it’s very hard.
"CapCut is an amazing app, good quality and makes my editing so much easier. But, for some reason the app for me keeps freezing up. I tried restarting but it doesn’t seem to work. Can this problem be fixed?"
Very good editing app but I’m having this issue when none of my photos are appearing and even after I close the app multiple times it sill does not appear. This happens everywhere I go
"well i think this is a AMAZING app,the only way i can get moving clips is gifs,and it just makes gifs stickers,so i can’t figure out another way to get moving clips,It’s a REALLY great app though(if you cannot change it to where it lets gifs work that’s fine though)"
"I am always using cap cut very cool app, I hate when u want to make a video it says I need to clean up phone storage they are my photos and memories why would I have to erase photos , you should really change that because it getting annoying"
I would totally recommend it easy and free it’s just like video star editing but free and way easier! But recently I’ve been trying to edit but it says “insufficient storage” I’ve deleted so much even the other edits! I’m not sure what to do please tell me how to fix this please.
This app is so good every editing app that I get you don’t get everything because you have to buy it but this app all of it’s free and there’s a lot of options for everything
I am astonished. This app has no in-app purchases nor ads! I am speechless. I have no complaints. This app has gotten my 5 star. I wish for CapCut to develop even further because this is the app that I ever wish for. Thank you for making this app exist!
This app this the best free video editing software you can get. But I think it could use one thing. A subtitles feature. After you record your video it would make subtitles if you said anything. This would save a lot of work.
"I love this app, I enjoy all the features and the complete joy it gives while I edit my videos, however, it has come to my attention that the “styles” button no longer appears, whats up with that?"
The app is definitely the BEST editing app I have ever used the only problem is that for some reason it’s not letting me use new effects because it says that I’m not connected to the internet even though I am.
"I have to say, it’s very easy to use! But, sometimes it says ‘insufficient storage. Please free up some phone storage and try again’ and I have enough storage, it’s a bit annoying at times. I’ve deleted and reinstalled the app many times because of this, I hope it gets fixed, but besides that it’s good to use! <3"
This app has literally what many other other been trying all these years. Seriously after this app u not longer need to use any other app to edit videos. #Amazing
Hey so I’ve been using capcut for a while and I really like it. But the thing is after I spend time making a edit I save it and it always goes off beat. Which is really annoying because I spend time on my edits. So yea I don’t know if it’s only me or if it’s my phone but I just hope that gets fixed.
"When I was going to make an edit for my friend I use style but this day it was not there,so I was confused so I updated the app and still nothing,does any one know how to fix this or did CapCut take away the effect?"
"I was making a bfb edit cause why not and right when I needed Velocity BOOM gone, goner than the money I got on my birthday taken by my mom
I was so mad and kinda still is PLEASE bring back the style button so people who need velocity don’t have to freaking die during the process of making velocity"
"I like CapCut, it’s a good editing app and explains it pretty well for newer people, the problem is that none of the updates are there, like the auto velocity thing, no matter what I do it’s never there, I really hope they fix it"
Capcut is a good app to edit I use it very often but when I wanted to make a Velocity edit it wouldn’t show the option in styles? I thought it was because I didn’t update the app but when I went to check it just said “OPEN” so am really confused.
I always loved capcut and never had an issue with it until recently. Like every time i try to zoom in a clip it never goes to the part where i wanna zoom in and now the audio is messed up when I do overlays. The audio never matches the beat and starts at a later time and i’ve redownloaded the app just for it to be the same… Fix this?
"Hey! This app is awesome for beginners and advanced editors! I started with capcut and i still use it to this day! First of all here are some reasons why i love capcut! The stickers are ADORABLE, awesome text animations, keyframes to animate, masking, and i absolutely LOVE the animations! I love this app, you should try it out! (Best for beginners) <33"
"Amazing app, very easy to use to make edits when im bored! The new slow-mo is really amazing. I just recommend that the app should add in 'HSL' coloring along w/ 'Selective HSL' which would be better for certain edits instead of the 'color negative, ec.' effects. I also recommend the app adds 3d things <3"
CapCut is a good editing app for beginners but when I updated it it was not working it says when I press “new project” “CapCut needs access to photos” when I look at settings I don’t see photos. I downloaded it again and it still is not working!
Capcut includes so many incredible features without any cost at all! The app makes it so easy to make your videos look amazing. I would definitely recommend using this app.
So I started making very good edits but one day I went to edit a video and it said all my videos were deleted. I was devastated I didn’t know what to do I started to cry all my hard work was gone. And I deleted the app. So now I’m gonna try again. But if this happens ever again. I’d make a complain.
Hi CapCut owners I would like to say that this app is amazing app so many things you can make with CapCut but i also wanted you guys or girls to know that I did not get the new update that you guys or girls had just put in a couple days ago
"Hi! I love your app so much but the thing that makes me super mad is when I try to do transitions and it say no WiFi when I have full bars of WiFi. And it says it every time I try to use transitions so if you could find a way to fix that, it would be amazing! 

I love your app 😁"
"It’s really great and all I learned new hacks, there’s good effects transitions, etc. but my only problem is that whenever I try speeding my video up, it likes to do its own thing and choose the speed up for me, if you can fix that I’ll gladly appreciate it!!"
This is the best app for editing I was a rookie but now I know how to edit more and better capcut is the best for beginners capcut is a good app compared to some other apps I downloaded I didn’t know how to work them but capcut makes it so easy to edit!
"First of all this app is fantastic and great for beginners. Has an awesome and simple UI and easy to learn. And its 100% free. Happy to keep using this app but it needs some improvements and additions: 

1- When slowing clips we need a smooth version bc it becomes very choppy and not usable
2- it would be nice to have motion blur for effects
3- lastly to help improve or keep video quality bc sometimes it turns out worse than when you imported it in

Otherwise I love this app and suggest it to any one who wants to start editing or not wanting to buy and editing app!"
"this is a great app for starter editors but I do have a couple things. One, i would love to have a thing we’re we could add our own fonts. i’ve seen people with androids do it but not apple users like me. Two, the slow-mo is not that great. I use VSCO for my slow motion but still if we could have good slow-mo it would cut a lot of time."
I was wondering if it were possible to make animations for the effects. I thought it would’ve been pretty cool to make the effects fade in or blur in or just other animations in generally
so this app is a good editing app like u can take away the watermark for free unlike other editing apps. but there is a bug where like the storage I DELETED ALL MY PICS MY VIDA AND STILL I DELETED 1 OF MY FAV APPS BUT STILL I HAVE LIKE 6 APPS AND 1 VIDEO NOW WHAT? u guys need to fix this. it is absolutely annoying. but still it is a good app. sorry for the short review.
"Hey! So I use this app ALOT and I have some recommendations so can you add like anime videos and velocity and slow then fast and I really want to edit an anime and it’s gonna be hard to record because I’m bad at timing so please I’ve want this since I got this app! Please add and thank you very much,❤️"
"This is the best ever you can do cool, effects without having to pay money for a small change to the video this is the best app I’ve seen I defenitly recommend it dosent have any bugs and I just love it"
"It is the best app
We want you add the person language because in Afghanistan , Iran and Arabia people are used 

Accept our request 
We waiting the next update to include the person language"
"Dear, CapCut 

Your app is Fantastic! And there’s so many effects and sounds. 
Please add more effects and sounds. 
My parents were amazed by this software, and I recommend all YouTuber’s to get the app. This app is perfect. Thank you for reading, have a nice day or night! Bye! 👋"
Thanks for making this I been trying to find a good app for editing/making videos but all the others needed money and I didn't understand😔 Anyways Thank youuu😭 lol
I love this app and all of its features. It’s got everything I need and is easy to use. I wish I could get a version for my laptop so I could use it for my bigger protects
"I edit a lot on mobile. I used Videoleap premium btw. But comparing that to this app, I’d say Capcut is way better in numerous way. Plus this app is FREE. There are so many effects to choose from, I’m just surprised that a free editing app like this can compete with PAID EDITORS. 5 STARS!"
"This app was amazing for the first month I used it. But then it started saying that I didn’t have enough storage to make videos, but I have a lot of storage on my phone. And it won’t let me upload certain pictures because “my internet connection is bad” even though my internet is fine. I used this app almost everyday and I used it to edit all of my videos but it doesn’t work any more:( I am very disappointed"
okay so I am a editor and I use video star but now I have seen capcut this app underrated!! like seriously for real this app great for beginners😊❤️ this helps them become an amazing pro editor ( ps idk why people using the fake editing app vinkle it steals edits! ) so yeah capcut is the best app ever for beginners😁❤️❤️❤️
"I love this app so much! But it needs like similar effects and transitions if they look at vs it would make everyone think that it’s a really good app, plus they should add some watermarks from alight motion it would be cool to have some of those there 😂 best app though 😌"
I love everything on this app it has no watermarks and everything thing is free and it is hard to find apps that have NO watermarks and it dose not take up my storage but this app is a 10/10 for me and it is easy on the go!
"I’ve been using this app for a while🙂 and now it doesn’t let me type anything or do anything except animate the videos😬 it really makes me mad :/ , but other than that your app is really great and I hope you can fix it☺️ !"
It’s a nice edit app the only problem is that whenever I add a new photo to my gallery that I want for my edit it doesn’t show in the app. It’s really annoying and I’ve tried deleting it and installing it again but it still didn’t show up. Other then that it’s good so I rate it 3 stars for that problem.
The app seems to be freezing usually around the 6 minute or longer time and it happens most often. If you could just maybe update the app that Would be wonderful. Other than that everything is amazing.
It is amazing it’s completely free no watermark. I love it get it. It did take me a little bit to figure out how to get the editing and all the features that it offers. Once you get it down it’s amazing Best editing app I’ve ever downloaded.
"When i found out they removed 3d zoom i uninstalled capcut and used a vpn to see if it would connect to a country that still has it. i lost all my projects. all that hard work. all those amazing montages, gone in the blink of an eye."
Capcut is amazing I love that everything is free unlike other video editing apps. There are so many premade effects to choose from and so many more things! I recommend capcut for sure!
"Recently, the style effect has gone missing. I have been very disappointed with it because I like making edits with 3d zoom and more of those effects. If they bring it back, I will change my review to 5 stars."
"capcut is a really great editing app! I use it every day! However, i hate that, on iPad, whenever i try to use camera and flip it to make it face my face, it doesn’t flip. It just uses the back camera, not the front. Please please please PLEASE fix this!! It’s really getting on my nerves!!"
"So, I love capcut but I have a little suggestion… can u put squiggly borders around the edits people try to make? You maybe could put it into the ‘effects’ section! :-) That would be so nice! That’s all from me please read this! :-)🐱"
"I love this app but can you make tweening easier, also you should put graphs when you move your thing the format should have additional stuff"
I’ve been using CapCut since late 2020 so I have a lot of experience but the feature that lets you use a tiktok audio doesn’t work it always says I’m offline THATS my main issue and if I use more then 3 effects it gets really laggy
"Usually when I do updates nothing happens like the new velocity thing I don’t have it, for the style I only have the 3 normal ones. If this is a bug pls try to fix it."
I highly recommend this app to new editors it’s very simple and easy but still has a lot of options to choose from for editing. Plus you can remove the watermark!
I like capcut it helps us with editing and it’s getting better and better and I like the new slow mo update I really like the updates so you should download this app I think it’s great in my opinion!
"When I joined the CapCut community I was so lost on how people were doing velocities,and the best edits just by using CapCut. CapCut is so good it has smooth slow mo,animations,velocity,good quality(overlays),and so easy to use! I hope all of you guys enjoy CapCut."
"Whenever I change my internet connection while the app is open, when I try to look at my sound from tiktok it’s says I have no internet connection and cannot access them."
I LOVEEEEEE THIS APPP!! Ive been using it for 2 years I've been improving on my editing skill and stuff but I would love for this app to have effect skills like the blur effect fading in and out it would help me with a lot of editing videos for tiktok and stuff :>!!
"One of the best phone editing apps seen, from the multiple choices of animations and being able to import custom fonts is amazing, still more places to improve but it’s amazing for being free"
"So first of all I really like this app, it help me with school, videos, and many others things but I thinks that they should give more music options like we can search or give us music that give us suggestions"
"When making velocity’s and wanting to slow clips down, they always end up really laggy. Do you think you could add something that allows it to “smoothen” kind of like vsco? thanks!"
okay i love the app i had it sense 2years i been on it i love it so much but it says something and i go on ur capcut thing and u can’t find won that’s off that will fix the problem pls help with this and i need better quality on my roblox edits i love the app dj much tho it’s my second fav pls do what i asked or i will never be able to edit on this it won’t go away 😢😭😭😭😭🥺pls help wit this promise creators i luv u for making the app ;);( but it won’t go away it started a day ago
"As the title says, this has got to be the best video editor out there and it's all free! But I wish features such as uploading your music (from say files) and iCloud saving/syncing across devices were here. Please consider adding these features!"
It’s a great app and has a lot of potential but theres not that much transitions and they’re really basic and it would be great if the slow motion wasn’t so bad maybe smooth it out and add more transitions that aren’t terrible and it would be amazing.
"i love this app and i make a lot of edits with it but at one point it said i had no more room to make any more i had to delete all of my edits and it still wouldnt work then i deleted over 10,000 photos and videos and it STILL didnt work so if you could fix this it would be amazing to amoe more edits again"
"It’s the best app for editing I’ve ever seen you can do different tricks on them you can edit different ways you can do what you want to edit you can grab video you can grab photos it’s the best app 
I seen"
Hey CapCut workers !!! You did amazing with this app. But it’s hard for me to do velocity and the slow motion so can you guys add smooth slow motion cause I use a app and it cost just for the slow motion so if you guys see this please do this for the next up!! Love the app ❤️
Okay so I started using this app before it got popular but i've started noticing when I add effects it gets super laggy and I cant see what the results are. The audio glitches and then the video stops for a few seconds and starts again?
I love the app I’m really good at making edits on it but one complaint is that when I slow my videos instead of slowing it basically makes it laggy can you fix that??
I love all about except I only done two edits and it already told me that I don’t have enough storage even though I have 15 pictures and barely any apps it keeps doing that to me every time that gets to a point I have zero pictures left so That’s alll
So when I’m bored I feel like editing something but of course it takes to long and hard without this app this app is amazing! I also I love with my edits so much now and it’s let’s your mind free and the finishing touch is the best
"I love the CapCut app but I have one problem it keeps asking me to confirm when I try to post and I don’t know how to confirm and I can’t find any videos about it, I was like, oh it probably needs some updating but it’s not letting me update it and I have a TikTok and people are still waiting for my video to post someone please help me"
"This app is amazing! It’s easy to use, and I got this app as a beginner with 0 problems. It runs very smoothly on my iPad, but it lags on my phone. The app itself is amazing, and feature-packed. 10/10 recommend!"
"I love this app. It’s really good for beginners in editing and it also is very easy to make edits with. But I can’t use it anymore because it says my storage is full. So now I’m using video star but it’s to hard to use so I can’t edit right now. :(

If Capcut is reading this, please update your app to let people actually edit."
This app is great but for some reason whenever I try to upload a video it keeps saying “insufficient storage” and it keeps happing I hope CapCut fixes that but other than that this app is a 10/10!
"This app is for beginners who likes to edit. This is a baby step. You pretty learn how to edit and do basic things. After that,You go to Video star. But you have to pay in order to use Video Star. Capcut is a pretty good app."
"I was going to edit a video but I realized that I couldn’t make it longer so I would have to keep adding the same video over and over again. Is that a new update? Because that “feature” makes it very hard to edit. Other than that, this app is very is a very useful edit app!"
"Five stars. My edits are trash before and noe its amazing! Thanks to thid app i got 6k follows🙃 but you should add a button thats the same like filters, “add to all” because i get annoyed of putting the same effect. Bye hope you read this and download it😗"
"A few months ago I have seen CapCut in a tutorial, I just thought it was a normal editing app, nothing special. BUT ITS NOT! I have made like intros for people on my channel! People LOVE IT! I love the effects so so so so so so so so so so so SOOOO MUCH! My favorite is the butterflies they look so real! -Love, Taco."
So I love this game it works so good but the problem is I cant take videos back like revive them I accidentally deleted my video I spent 2 hours editing and I don't know how to revive it. Its been 30 minutes and I'm still crying can you please fix this.
This app is really good to edit I don’t know why people be hating on this app. This app Gives you no watermark and all the effects are 💯% Free I love this app so I give it 5 Starts I edit so much in this application Thank you for making this application! 👍
"the effects are so easy and makes me feel like a real editor without any effort, I will be using it for the rest of my life! I also love how we can remove the watermark/ending for free, way better than any other app- get this."
It’s really perfect I like the app it has no watermark and it’s hundred percent free it’s better than any Free editing apps I ever use but I would suggest some stuff like like if we can add our own transitions or create them I think that will be very cool
"Oh my god, first off this app MY GOD, all is free!! Which I had just got this app and I was like, I need to rate this... so far no bugs- at the end though is has the CapCut logo, but that dose not really matter- this has SOO MUCH to offer. You should definitely try this out 🤗🤗"
This app is great I use to make tiktok edits almost every other day. But I do find myself having to switch apps because the transitions are very fast and I wish I could slow them down a little bit. But aside from that this app is amazing!!
"So, I just want to say that I am overall... SHOCKED!!! I have NEVER in my life came across an app like this! It has to be the app of 2021. I heard this app on many Gacha Life videos and edits, and I thought “why not give it a shot?” So I did, and it is incredible. Great work!"
So the app is great I well be using it a lot more but the bling effect is not working like it’s says “no Internet connection” but I’m connected to Internet even when I shut my internet on and off it won’t work and reboot my phone it won’t work but over all I like the app.
I love this app so much because for one it doesn’t make u pay for good editing tools like other apps out there and it’s really good and easy to use so I definitely recommend this app to people looking to edit
This is probably one of the best editing apps I’ve ever tried. I’m a small TikToker and this helps so much! It’s compatible for all devices for FREE! I have no words for how many hours of editing this has saved me. It’s so simple yet very detailed.
"This is a very short review but I have barely started CapCut and it’s an amazing app!! So so easy to use and really understanding and fun to use!! I also love how I can  extract the sound form any video and use it, that really really helps!! :)"
I’ve never seen such a good transitions and editing app I love this app and it took a while to find a good editing app because this one is so underrated but it is such a good app perfect! I will definitely suggest this app to family and friends!
"I’m a editor for Fortnite montages and Jesus, this app has surprised me very much. You can do so much with such a free app! I would suggest deleting Kinemaster or Videoleap, because the stuff you need is HERE! Probably the best Mobile editing software so far for editors like me."
I like this app because it does really good edits and I like the things u can do to edit a video. But my problem is that while I’m editing some of the effects don’t let me work idk why which is weird cuz it used to let me use all the effects and now ur doesn’t.😭😔
"This app is phenomenal honestly one of the best you can get for free, although there is no audio equaliser or landscape orientation implementation. if these features and more such as, mouse and keyboard compatibility i would make a one time purchase with no hesitation."
1 star for now I wish I can put no stars This app deserves no stars because I am unable to add imports from my phone to edit it let me for 10 minutes and now I can’t do anything plz fix this problem plz I star for now but I will be uninstalling the app and you will be given no stars for the actions of this horrible app can’t Evan add what I want to edit that a shame no stars goodbye
This app is free and make the best edits but can y’all please add more effects and tools😢I thinks your better than viedostar I use this app every day I’m obsessed thank you for making this app and add effects and animations like video star btw Best app in the world💜
"I’ve bought like 5 apps to edit which I regret because it’s been months and I still can’t figure out how to use them even with watching vids but this app? It’s the sugar honey ice tea it comes with a bunch of cool transitions, effects etc. and ITS FREE"
The stuff you can do on this app is insane I’ve done edit that I would not be able to do on my other editing app but the only bad thing is my phone isn’t powerful enough for it to run smoothly (but that’s on me) AN AMAZING APP I LOVE IT
"I mainly use capcut for tiktoks, but there is so many cool effects, fonts, stickers and more! You can even add fonts and add multiple videos!! There are amazing transition hacks and LOTS of absolutely AMAZING different effects and filters! Download it and join the amazing fun!! ❤️"
"so, I started using CapCut when they were not adding any news effects. When they added the velocity, I was never able to use it. I re-downloaded CapCut and I updated it to. So idk whats wrong with it but pleaded fix this!"
I love CapCut I have been using it for awhile to make edits on tiktok I have over 6k followers with a velocity only acct but now that they took auto velocity off I can’t do any edits and I’m losing followers I just wish they brought it back
Before this update I could make videos and adjust the exposure and sharpen it and it would look amazing now after this recent update when I try to do it after I export it make my video laggy please fix it
"Hi, so my CapCut animations and affects aren’t working and I’ve updated the app and it’s still not working so I’m wondering if you guys can fix it I make intros and I can’t make any without CapCut :/

Amazing app though!!! <3"
it’s really good but there is one thing when I type it sometimes disappears and when I close it doesn’t go away if you can fix it I will be happy thank you!
"I have been using this app for 2 years and love it! The only problem is that the slo-mos are not smooth. It would be nice if there was somehow a smooth option when making the speeds of a video. But other than that, very impressed."
This app is really good it helps me edit but every single time I do something a glitches let me tell you the first things I hate (1: whenever I click on the effect it says try again later (2: my thing keeps glitching (3: every single time I try to make a edit it says my storage is full
I love this app in my opinion I feel like it’s better than any other editing app and it’s necessary not to like it here and there but other than that I 100% recommend this app!
So CapCut is a good app overall with the editing and stuff like that but I recommend for the camera part to make filters an better yk so not being mean I just giving a suggestion 👍
Don’t get me wrong CapCut is really good but I don’t know if it’s just me but my game clips freeze at certain spots I’m currently working on a montage then the game clips just freezes  again I don’t know if it’s just me but please fix
I love this app it easy and it easy to master unlike other apps I had come across but the thing it needs to work on is the loading it takes forever to load but it still the BEST APP
"The app is good for making basic videos, and it is very easy
To edit the videos. Like I already edited to videos in some hours or minutes you should get this app"
"I was looking for the bgm collection of sound effects, and they’re no longer there?! I tried updating the app to see if it would return them but they were still missing. Is anyone else having this problem? What’s happening?"
"CapCut if your reading this, I like it apo but ig has some issues for me and plus in on an iPhone 7+ So don't complain... You apo is good but The ""Remove backround Is like removing the whole picture.. And othe people can do it but not me 🙁 It just removes the whole picture for me so can u fix it?"
i love capcut it’s one of the best editing apps i have it helps out a lot and has very good quality i love it so much and it’s 100% FREE it’s so good to use when ur bored and want to make a edit please omg please download it i 100% recommend.♥️♥️♥️
"If you ask for my opinion, if you are a video person you absolutely NEED this app. It has made my videos cooler and more action. I don’t have much to say but anyone I mean anyone needs this app it awesome."
"✨This is by far the best app I’ve ever used I can’t imagine not having Capcut! They update once a week, They have so many filters, effects and they even have tutorials! This is a great app, I 100 % think you will love this app! <3"
"This app is wonderful and all but sometimes it lags a lot when I’m trying to preview my edit, also I wish it had 2k/4K quality for all devices"
"I love CapCut because it is so easy to use and when I first started to edit on CapCut it was just a blast ! So I keep using it, I also suggested this app to my friends so they can also get to editing ! <3"
"CapCut is the best app for editing. ❤️ whenever I need to edit something or put something together, it’s always the most fun app to use! 🍀✨ but the only thing is I wish that there were face distortions- but it’s ok! CapCut is amazing 😻"
So this app is simply amazing I love making edits on it. The suggestions I have are: 1. Be able to favorite our edits 2. Be able to sort edits into folders that would make it easier for organizing them and stuff
"Love this app, it’s literally amazing and so easy to use. But, it does have really bad quality on the videos I make and it takes up a lot of storage. But I would still recommend."
This app is the only app I’ve used for making videos cause it’s just super awesome and the effects and everything omg thanks so much CapCut for helping all of us.
Really love it so far! easy to use for edits and lots of effects that i like to use. they’ve recently added graphs as well which is amazing! maybe a later update could be for video masking?
"Well, I deleted capcut because something wasn’t working and I have done this before and I tried to re download it but it asked me to put the password in I did that and it asked me to pay for it I am aware capcut is a free game I’m also righting this on ipad please help me someone"
I swear this is the best app for anime edits I will rate is 5 but I have a request I just want the slow mo to be smooth and I want the resolution like the print to be god Dam nice but still thanks for making this app I would’ve never been good with edits if it weren’t for u cap cut THANKS !
"Capcut is amazing, but theres one problem a couple days ago a went onto cap cut and all of my projects had been gone and i was working really hard on an edit it didn’t even look like it was made on capcut. But i spent 1 week on it and i lost all of the progress, i was sad about that but the app is great!"
It’s good but ever since then I upload my videos or edits it’s always laggy and idk why I’m just having a hard time because when I play it in the app it’s not laggy but when I finish it and upload it all together it’s laggy and more slower😭
"So good ! But I have some suggestions. First of all, try adding some graphs because it would make the effects so much better! Second I think you should add some shakes and colorings."
So I was going to create a Roblox edit with KineMaster but I decided not to kineMaster because it’s kind of hard ;-; so I decided to download this and then try to do Roblox edit and it worked :D I recommend you download this because it’s very fun to use :)
Idk what is happening but I love this app but… it keeps randomly flashing pink and it was stressful but I hope the people at CapCut can fix this problem. Maybe it’s because I have too much in my edits or what but I just want them to fix this!
"“Insufficient storage clean up some photos & try again “ I only have 200 photos please try fixing that if not idk it’s probably my phone such a great app to edit, & find audios thank you very much if you fix it or not !"
"So I love editing on capcut but I just deleted 1,000 things of photos and videos because it says insufficient storage but I literally have 900 pictures and videos now and I don’t even have a lot of apps and I keep closing out but idk why it isn’t working"
I LOVE this app but it has a glitch the glitch is after I put the photos in and then go to import it says “there’s no photos here” which I have many so can you fix that please? Thank you 😊
"I would really like to see 2k to 4k quality option. I have an old device but I really need good quality my parents will refuse to buy me a newer device, so please fix this! Thx"
Hi! This app is just amazing! I’d love to thank you for making everything free! It’s makes me so happy! I normally never give editing apps 5 stars. But this one just amazed the crap out of me! It’s FREE! Like- no editing all that I have used is free-
I have been using this for over a month and it is good but I wish they can add something to where you can download a font on to the app so you can use it but overall it is good
"I love this app because it’s free getting it, and using it. The music is good and if you get to understand the game, you surely will enjoy it. For example I made a montage and shared it with my family and they loved it. Thank You CapCut"
I have installed this tday but I can’t use effects & transition Whenever i click those option it shows no internet connection but i have connected to internet 🤷🏻‍♂️🙄
"CapCut is 100% free and everyone on it is free no paying for anything, but if you’re storage is full it doesn’t let you make a video but overall it’s an amazing app, I would definitely recommend it"
"i really like this app and i've been using it for a couple of months now for my edits and it's really easy and fun!! but maybe u can add a feature like graphs for the speed of a transition and an animation if u have time? if not that's totally fine don't worry! i just want to be able to change the timing of the speed of the transitions without having to change the speed of the video, too. there could possibly be a curve option for transitions and animations or a speed of them? thanks and have a great day!! 😊"
I love capcut but every time I tried to get into the at my storage is full and I have to delete so much stuff just to edit please remove that if my storage is full it’s still let me edit in my storage is not full capcut is taking up all my storage that’s why it’s full and that’s just not right with me
So I like the game but every time I make something it keeps moving cus I’m trying to make a thing called tween edit and I need different body parts and when I put one down it keep moving and the whole thing starts glitching and I need that to be fixed please cus it keeps glitching and starts moving the thing I need
Although this is a video editor it doesn’t work very well with videos over 5 minutes but that doesn’t matter I use it for anime edits it’s free so it’s not gonna be like after effects but hey it’s still great!
I would give this a 5/5 if they still had the auto velocity feature..I don’t know if it’s just me but they removed this..otherwise very user friendly and I would get it back if they add it back
Idk if I’m the only one having this problem but it says insufficient storage and I tried deleting the app and redownloading it but it wouldn’t even let me make 1 video so I deleted it again and didn’t even let me download it back. I thought my storage was full but it says 199.7 GB out of 2 TB used so it’s definitely not full. I deleted 457 photos and 91 videos but it still didn’t work. I don’t know what’s going on
Don’t get me wrong I LOVE this app it’s free you don’t need to buy anything plus it has no water mark but it would be MUCH better if there were some newer transitions and effects that’s all.
"Being one of those people who barely ever write reviews, this had to impress me a whole lot. I’ve been looking for a decent app to make short edits on my phone and boy did I hit the jackpot. Its amazing on all ends. Thumbs for the devs, you are the GOATs."
I’ve been using the app for months and now I can’t even edit my videos are gone and the overlays aren’t working and can y’all please add more because the apps amazing I love it and I need to edit more so please fix
"When I download this app I was a bit skeptical because I saw it as a Snapchat add, and normally they are not very good apps with a lot of adds. This was not the case for this app. This app has helped me so much and is so easy to use."
I never thought i would right a review on any app ever but please bring the style button back soon!!! Alot of people including myself are upset about this 😭
This is an amazing editing app I would’ve given it a 5 star but there’s a bug that I don’t like basically when I first open the app and o want to add a picture there all gone so I have to restart the app to get the pictures back
"So, I’ve been using this app for a while and I love the animations but there’s only a few we can really use and I would really like to be more animations so I won’t use the same ones, But overall this is good app and would recommend. -Omari"
"I usually don’t have problems with this app but every time I make an edit/video it freezes and I don’t like that at all it
Ruins it and just messes up my edits I thought it was my storage but it’s really not it the app acting up on me maybe fix that glitch for please but overall the app is great."
When I first started using it I already knew what to do (thanks to one tutorial I watch) I like to make edit audios with CapCut and demon slayer edits but I had to delete it because I got in trouble 😞 but the new effects are AMAZING 🤩 like literally I love’ em like so much like yeah
I really like it but there is one thing I am concerned about once I was excited to make a video but it would not let me use tictok favorites it keeps saying Connect to the internet then try again when everthing else is working
"Lately I he all has been freezing ridiculously way to much, almost every 10 minutes it will freeze and kick me out over and over. Even my audio will cut in  and out and it slows down so much!"
"This is an amazing app for beginners that want to learn how to edit. It has simple tutorials, fun filters and effects, wonderful music, and most amazing part, ITS COMPLETELY FREE. Other editing apps cost too much money for simple things."
"( short review)

Very good app to use to edit it glitches a lot but once you export it it don’t glitch in the edit but while editing it does other than that it’s a good app."
"Your editing app is astounding! I love it a lot, but maybe you could add some stuff to it? Maybe like a “Shake Out” transition, and you can chance the frequency and amplitude for shakes. Overall, I love your editing app."
"this is a really good editing app. though, when my storage gets full it doesn't let me make a video. and i have to delete all my IMPORTANT photos and videos. this app is fun and games for when you have storage but if it’s full, it’s not fun in games."
I make edits using cap cut and vsco but capcut does most of the work! I have been using this for 2 years for a beginner it’s bot easy I found out all of this but looking threw all the cap cut stuff and yeah overall it’s a great editing app!!!!❤️
"you guys make it so easy to edit and even import images from photos! overall its very good and i have some suggestions (do them if you want)

suggestions
1. add a scale U.I. for image stickers
2. uh.. being able to move text around the screen without using the pre-made animations (2 modes by the way, dragging and animating and also goes for the stickers?)
3. uhh….. ran out of ideas!

best editing app 10/10

anyone who reads this should give it a try!"
"I mean the app is a really good app, it has everything you could really need now that there is graphs, but I feel like you guys should fix the custom graphs setting, it’s confusing to use and you can’t really get it to the liking you want"
CapCut is good but there shakes are really stiff and there transitions in general are stiff. They just need better animations is what I’m trying to say when you slow down the video or something like that it becomes glitchy
I had this app for a few weeks now and everything has been great! Many editing options and tools. Also it’s free! Which I love. 10/10 recommend.
"I have been using the app for a while and I think it is really cool! However there is one issue. When making an edit, it is on-beat, but as soon as I export it, the edit is off-beat from the song. Is this a glitch? Thanks!"
So CapCut is really nice I’m glad to have I make them and show them to my friends it’s really useful for people with TikTok I think people should use it I mean like CapCut Is a decent game you csn make cool effects and stuff so I think it’s pretty nice
CapCut is bizarre but I had a bug where I couldn't have a full  voice over! Please fix this but overall 10/10 I would recommend this for sure!
"Hello, CapCut this app is a great editing high quality app, I use it for roblox edits and it’s great and I like this editor app so much thank you CapCut for making this app and there’s so many effects my fav effect is the angel in the shadow, I love this edit app so much thank you! Bye!!!"
So this app is a amazing it has wonderful music and other stuff and i use it to edit for my yt channel but... i was trying to edit when it said i did not allow it to my photos!smae with my other editing app!does any body know how to fix this?
Amazing app and the fact that it has no watermark makes it so much better! Please never change that. This app has so many good editing features so it’s definitely worth to get.
Hello owners of CapCut! I love this app and all but sometimes when I go to make a new edit it’ll tell me I have no photos when I do. I would like to ask if you could add a search feature for the songs and stuff. Also please do add more animations. Thank you and I love your app!
"This app is AWESOME i have a few requests, I would like for the community to add after effects transitions or/and effects. to be honest, the transitions are a bit choppy and no offense, not smooth. Also i want you to add text effects. THANK YOUU"
"Wow! I am super impressed! I am blown away by the hundreds of options you could use on your videos. Everything is free, fast-working, and top-quality. And the best part-you can remove the watermark!!"
"Ok first of all. This app is amazing! It is completely free and super easy to use! I personally recommend this app because I use it to edit my tik toks and it works very well, very good quality and no watermarks! So please download CapCut! I promise it’s worth it!"
This is one of the best apps I’ve ever used and I’m actually so surprised. I do say sometimes the video quality is bad but it’s workable and everything else is perfect! I love CapCut! There’s a watermark but you can delete IT! Continue to upgrade it!
I think this app is the best one that I ever came across and it should be the best app for editing videos I just wish that they can add audio quality because I like making Memes on this app and for that I rate it a five star😄😁
If you were seen this just download the app it is the best editing app out there I've ever tried saying this just click the get button and get the app it's so good I highly recommend
"I really recommend this app! Before I used iMovie and then my friends like hold up, you gotta use CapCut! And I am so happy I switched to CapCut. Not only that you can upload it to TikTok. I’ve used half of all my videos using CapCut. Great app!"
"I am a pro editor and I been working with CapCut for over a year now, but when ever I try to zoom in or move it it glitches bad it not working for me. I would recommend it but I need the glitch to fix before I can"
"Out of all the editing apps I have tried, this ones the best! It’s easy to master, and it has really good features. I love the transitions and effects! Sure, there are some problems, but overall I love it!!!"
So I was doing edit and the next day I will go about to do another edit but I realize that style wasn’t there so I couldn’t and I just wanted to let you know could you please add that back
I just wanted to make a edit but when I went to find style it wasn’t there. Did you guys remove the style thing because seriously why would you guys remove it???? I’m very upset about this right now.
"It is really good. When I first started it, I HATED IT! Then I was struggling on velocity until you guys added it which was the best. Thank you for adding that… Can we get some more effects and stuff? Like the person becomes black and a red background?? That would be nice!"
"I love this app! When I first started using this, I was confused, but now I know how to use this app! I have used this for 1-2 years! Amazing app! I hope you can add more effects in the future!"
"As a Tiktok CC I have tried MANY apps to edit and upgrade my videos. Using CapCut has made my life 1,000 times better!

Two things I will say:
   It takes a little time getting to know how to use the app. (But once you learn it, it’s a life saver!)
   I’d like to see more things removed from behind the pay wall. (Just a personal opinion)

All that being said, it’s a great app! Get it, learn it, and watch it change the way you make content!"
"Hello, I updated CapCut to the latest update (version 5.5.0) and I have the iPhone 12 and I was really excited to use the auto velocity feature, but the option is not being presented to me at all. I looked for it everywhere and it’s not on the app. How can I fix this?"
I love capcut ive been using it from when i started editing it got some really good updates i still use it even tho i prefer other apps this is really good keep up the good work capcut!
"I downloaded CapCut because my friend recommended it, and i did not expect it to be so good. I just LOVE this app it’s so simple and fun but still with a lot of great options! Keep on keeping on!"
"Capcut is an amazing started editor app!! I would definitely recommend and get it if you can!!

(Sorry for the short review 😅 it’s just that those two sentences sum it up, really)"
"CapCut is a great, easy to learn, feel-good editing app. With over a hundred no-copyrighted songs, to voice filters, and video transitions. I downloaded CapCut about 1 year ago, and I learned everything within 1 month."
This app is a very good app i just wish that you wouldn’t need internet to use it I also hope they can add water mark and that they make it easier to do the big glowing lights I don’t know how to explain it 😅 but other than that it’s a great app
I recently got this app and I am loving it! You can use all the features with needing to buy a monthly payment for the special features. I really appreciate this. Capcut also makes editing so easy and fun to do! 5 stars awesome app!
So I’ve been using this for a least two years now and it is amazing and I love it but you can’t really do a lot of things but over all it’s amazing it has Amazing edits and everything😁
"So I started CapCut about a while ago and honestly it’s great but I just think that the transitions needs to be cleaner, and maybe add more transitions. I also think that the slow motion is not that great and it needs to be better. Lastly, I feel like they should add more fonts that are trendy."
I really like this app it is really easy for people that just started editing. When I first downloaded it it was very easy to deal with. It has lots of cool filters and effects. I use it every day.
It says in my photos I have none pls fix that if u do that would be very kind thanks very much and also it would need a bit of improvement there should be a watermark instead of the CapCut outro
"okay soooo I love the app. It’s beyond amazingggg, and I’m so glad that they moved the good animations to the front 
lol that’s all I have to say but download this app if ur a starting editor, it’s really easy, and once you get the hang of it, it will turn out so good
trust me :))"
This app is probably the best editing app for FREE!!! It has everything other paid editing apps have and it’s all free there is no premium membership or anything this has to be the greatest app to ever come for editing
"When I try to use a video as music and when I only want to select a small part of said video. Instead of the clip it brings the whole video 

          Other wise great editing app keep up the great work"
"I love this app, I have made so many things with it. I just wanted to give a few suggestions about the app.

1. I would really love if you could make the slomo a lot smoother because when I do the slomo its really glitchy.

2. It would be amazing if you could add more smoother transitions/animations because the animations are amazing! It would just be fantastic if you could add smoother ones, like warping, or better shakes.

Thats all, and thank you for taking your time to read my review :)"
"I love capcut no complaints at all!!! I was wondering if you could add a feature that makes it so you can slow down the translations or the effects, whatever you wanna call it lol 😂 all in all love the app bye!"
"So, I like making my own transitions. And it’s pretty hard to do went you can’t rotate the material without losing the position and size. I would appreciate it if was easier to rotate. :) all in all it’s pretty good! I would definitely recommend."
"Random videos I made suddenly stop working. The pop up thing says it can’t update and it won’t even let me into the vid. Stuff I’ve worked hard on have had to be deleted cos I can’t do anything with them. 

Also, I’m unable to do animations and stuff like that. Please fix it"
"CapCut is such a great app and SUPER easy to use, but for the text I think you should add the text explosion like on video star :) but I’m living all of the cool updates :) Amytike I want to export an edit it never takes long and it’s so easy!"
I love the app it is a great app for editing although it is starting to have some problems but i know that can get fixied soon. But anyways it is a great app yo edit on and people even call me the perfect editor.
So I have switched editing from capcut to another editing app because it’s is so so so annoying when it says “too much storage” and I deleted like almost ALL my apps and photos and still says storage is full. I am switching editing apps and I will go back to capcut when they get this fix not worth deleting photos and apps AT ALL :/
This app is AMAZING! At first I thought it would be one of those apps where you have to pay to basically do everything. IT’S NOT THAT WAY. You can use so many affects and transitions. I use this app for editing videos for TikTok. THIS IS A MUST HAVE!!!
"capcut saved my life! it is such an amazing app and don’t get me wrong but at first I didn’t know how to use it but i learned on my own and know I have a successful edit account on tiktok!! it’s free and is better than video star, alight motion. I love capcut!!"
This is app is just AMAZING.I’ve been using this app to edit and when I first downloaded it and I was down with my edit and posted it on TikTok and I got 2.m likes on it.I hope you add more updates to this app it’s amazing
"This app is perfect the o my problem I have is it only exports to 1080p 60fps, I loved this app but after working with 2k and 4K clips I had to switch to another app for the quality. Please guys 🙏 add 2k or 4K or both if you can."
I have 78 photos and it says my storage is full so I’m give me to three and I need to make an edit so I don’t wanna use any other app I want to use CapCut so can y’all fix that they only have 78 Photos so I don’t know why my storage is full and my Settings doesn’t say anything about my storage being full so
"Don’t update this version at iPhone Xs Max...😭After update latest version more options doesn’t work.... effects, filters Text, format etc. Doesn’t work 😰😰😰"
i really like the app but i when i deleted some apps to make a edit it kept saying the same thing over and over again i had to delete some of my favorite apps
Honestly i think this app is better than any editing app out there. Its so easy to edit anything a baby could do it. Its sleek and smooth to handle and i haven’t had a problem with it yet!
Whenever I’m done editing and trying to save a video it plays the clip then freezes the screen while the audio is playing in the background could you please fix that it’s honestly annoying? And could we add all of the in and out and combo transitions all together instead of them being separate and can a developer please read this you need to fix your app
"This app is so amazing and I recommend this app if for people who can’t have video star I have a cousin who doesn’t understand about vs and she use this app and she said that is so amazing it has transitions,color,key,filters and more:)."
"I love this, updates daily, new edit choices, and more professional, only thing is, is that there’s one bug to where I can’t export music, please fix this problem🙏 Thank You❤️"
"So I love this app so much it's easy to use and learn however, there's always pixels in my videos even when I export it in 4k. Can that be fixed?"
The only thing that I could complain about is fixing the glitch in the new slow motion update whenever I use it theres a green flash that come up and it has happened to me twice now.
"My editing has improved so much on this app and it is really simple  to use! if you are someone who isnt that familiar with editing, and ur looking for an easy editing app to use, capcut is perfect for you!"
I think you should add a pen so we should trace it and do what ever we like. Another no is adding more effect like dissolve and character black out. Lastly you should upgrade the auto velocity.
"I hate when I’m trying to do a velocity edit, for example, I put the speed to 2.2x and it goes to 1.0x that’s what it does and I get me madder and madder I try my best to stop the problem but no still does it. I really hope y’all can fix this or I’m going to start using video star"
Yo i enjoy capcut a lot and have been using it for sometime but every time i export some stuff it deletes like all my files but the one I just made its very annoying on top of that some features like there new velocity update has yet to come on my phone im getting annoyed n would like help
"First off CapCut is a awesome app! It’s great for beginners and just editors in general but what I have noticed is the slow mo are really bad like if u want to a slow mo it’s choppy and very bad looking, please consider making the slow mo better other then that I like this app!"
"It was a amazing app to start with and help me with my beginning of editing but then it started saying something about payment billing and I’m young so idk and it’s not letting me download anything that is 5 min long so if you could fix that then I would love to come back to being one of your costumers
😉😉😉"
"I use capcut to make edits and I absolutely love the app. it’s easy to use and I’ve really improved since! however, it can get really laggy which is annoying but I don’t mind too much lol"
"I am SHOCKED that this app is free. How. How is it free?! It’s very user friendly, and that’s coming from someone with 0 VIDEO EDITING EXPERIENCE! It’s now the only app I use to make TikToks for personal and business use. Please never put this app behind a paywall! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ - A mega fan of this app"
Sometimes it gets a little bit glitchy but it’s great for beginners I recommend it if you want to start editing
First of all when I used cap cut I have to delete app or picture then it worked but... When I need capcut I will need to delete like 2 picture and 3 app and I think it's not fair to me that I will have to delete something  🙃
I love capcut I really do but I’ve been having an issue lately. When I go to make an edit it says it needs access to “ the album” so I click confirm but it already has access to everything!! I can’t even make edits now because of this and it makes me very sad please fix this :(
"This app is great for people who aren’t experienced at editing, I’ve used this for a couple of months and I’m a pro at it now! Definitely try this app if you want to edit your vids."
Would recommend for anyone who is looking for a video editor. I have been using this app for a little over a year now and it has never let me down.
please put more quality in the Videos new professional transitions new professional effects And I really want it because I want to start editing and I want to start well thaks!
"Capcut is fun but only for a short period of time. After a little while of playing I got flooded with bugs. It also requires a lot of storage and uses a lot of memory. I recommend getting everything off of capcut when you can, so you can access it."
This is a very amazing app. I just wish they had a profile you can make so that you won't lose your stuff. Sadly my cap cut restarted and took down everything I was making.
Everything is amazing thats mostly all I have to say but when previewing the edit sometimes it can be slow or laggy. Thats my only consern. I also love the newish update with the 3D thing its really cool!
Ok so I know I probably don’t know to much about CC but it is easy to use and It has amazing transitions and as a gachatuber I recommend it but It isn’t that good at animating things lol but I still like it so would totally recommend. :)
I just downloaded it I’m still getting to understand it but it’s awesome you can do so much edit pics make videos and music and voiceover it makes editing easy I love it it’s much easier than I movie
"i love everything about capcut. i make fancams with this app, people love the way they turn out and so do i! it’s such a user friendly app, and there are only two things i wish i could change. 

please, let us rename exported sounds and delete them from our exported library. i’ve searched high and low for how to do both of these things, but never found an answer for them.

this app is a godsend and those two improvements would make this app even better."
I love this app sm it’s one of the best editing apps out there but I think it requires a little too much storage just to edit it on I literally was in the middle of editing and then it exited me out the app and when I tried finishing the edit all of a sudden it said I had no more storage
The app is good but there is a lot of glitches and it will just freeze when I click on the project and when I go on the edit it doesn’t load fast or it will kick me out of the app so can u please fix those glitches
"I love this app because first of all i make gacha videos (just for myself) and it really looks good so 5/5 i will give! Ive been trying really hard to get good apps for my gacha videos and they dont work, but this one does so I LOVE THIS APP"
I love this app it’s useful but there’s a LOT of bugs 1. It says infinite storage! And I have to delete the app and open it again. 2. It says Couldn’t import try again TO MANY TIMES!! 3. When I’m trying to edit it goes a little bit pixelated. Overall it’s a good app I would say..
Please let me make more videos I try so hard to do a video and it just says can’t make a video.. please just please let me make more videos thank you..
"I LOVE IT SO MUCH! It is so much easier then editing on video star 100%. And it’s also free!! It is so useful! One thing, could you make it so you can put an animation at the beginning and end? If no that is fine, just a suggestion. Have a good day!!"
"This is the best app ive ever used to edit, everything is easy and simple and has a beautiful Selection of things to pick from BUT pls do a filter or something for the trend shugar crush! Everyone tries to do it and needs help figuring it out!"
"Don’t get me wrong, CapCut is amazing after all it’s just that I wished you could add more layers. Because when I edit Gacha I need about 12 layers but the max is 6 🥺. Oh and when it comes to tweening, I was wondering if you could let us add to our key frames such as the KF tempo because their really slow. Keep up the good work!"
"Great app! Amazing for editing videos. The only thing I don’t like is that u cant control how thick the lines are when you’re making a video. Like say u made an editing and the video zooms out, there’s weird lines framing the video that u can’t control."
"My friends have told me to download this app for editing gacha videos, so i did. it seems hard at first but once i got used it, i deleted kinemaster, haha! i love this app because multi layere and many effects are free. way to go!"
"It’s normally great but lately the animation and effects, and things like that haven’t been working and they’ve been saying check internet. My internet is working but I think it’s the app. I would give five stars but this is a big issue."
"i love capcut, i’ve been using it for a while! however, ever since the new update, the reverse feature isn’t working (“Couldn’t reverse. Try later”); it’s been like that for a few days, perhaps it’s a bug?"
Ok so first off the app is pretty much great but as I was making a video I was adding transitions and I click the Camera Transitions and if you scroll to the very far right it says (and I quote) “Top Rght” so maybe if you could fix it then BAM flawless
"i really love this app , it allows me to make clean edits without the watermark. My only problem is that the audio is delayed while editing the video but when you export the video everything is synced"
I’ve used CapCut for two years but I can’t click one he style effect anymore idk if it’s just me can you please fix it- or add it back if you deleted it
"I get so mad with this because sometimes if I put a video in, it takes all my photos and puts them in my deleted album, it’s so annoying! And then it also freezes my phone and won’t let me close it! It’s a helpful app just that it glitches way too often, I wouldn’t really recommend.."
"i honestly love this app and all but I have been having so many problems with it saying “ no internet connection “ I have full bars , I tried everything. but the app it self is amazing with editing totally recommend! 💓"
I never really liked capcut because i couldn't make velocity edits but now they have the new slow mo and all that i can make the perfect edits. i knew that capcut was gonna make slow mo i'm so glad they are:)
It’s great I’ve used for years but jeeZzzzz whenever a try to make shorter clips for Photos it’s extremely choppy and no photos show up. Whenever I try to make smooth slow motion it takes a whole year to download :\ I use it because it’s the easiest editor app I can find.
So I love CapCut I learned to edit in like 10 minutes! But there is a bug where I can’t use a TikTok audio. It always say I’m not in connection:( I had to re-install the app like 3 times for it to work. Please fix this. Otherwise this app is amazing
"I Suggest Using This! One thing, Its the Volume, Its Only changes Slightly.. Other than That The App Its- Just Amazing! I Use It Every Day And I Say I Improve. One Of My Favorite Things i've Ever Downloaded. Thank You So Much To Whoever Made This, Capcut Is Great! Have A Great Day. ᰔ☾˙❀‿❀˙☽"
So at first I didn’t rly like it but now that I have a tik tok Account for edits I use it a lot and it’s fun or like to crop videos so I recommend it but there’s also other apps you can use in my opinion capcut  is the best :)!.
"Amazing editing app , the only thing I see wrong is it takes up way to much space on you device"
"I really like this app and the fact that I don’t have to pay for anything makes it better, but I kinda wish that we had a little more effects like hue shift or warp/distorsion idk"
New things to add in CapCut is more combo and maybe you sooner or later have a option to chose both to make your own animation and you can have combo and everything else like normal and more new effects
"They need shakes if they had shakes it would
Be so much better and they need constant shakes to where you make your own style of shakes and they need the graphed to where you can make your own graphs where it has 2 circles"
Incredible features. Accurate AI tracking. Had to check my bank account twice if I had accidentally bought this for $1000 because I can’t believe this is free.
I used capcut for over a month and I have to say it is great. I feel like the chroma key needs improvement and the remove background is really cool but needs improvement. I would really love custom masking that would be cool. I love capcut it’s really simple to use and very fun.
"The app is good just it say that you don’t have enough storage you will have to delete pictures,apps or edits you worked really hard on even if you add storage to your phone it will still say there’s no enough storage like at all"
I used to hate the app because I didn’t understand it but I looked at some tutorials and now I make such cool edits and I feel like my tiktok profile if growing so much more! And this app is free and it’s easy to use if u gain practice!
The content and features you get with this app without everything being stuck behind a paywall is phenomenal! Plus there are minimal ads! 10/10
"This is awesome. No other words. You can remove backgrounds without green screen, and that is gonna help me in my upcoming Friday the 13th Fan Film. If you need an editing app or second in command, look no further than CapCut. ☺️Five stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
"This app is very good!! But I do request some things u guys should add...if u guys can add some shake animations, more texts fonts and animations, more auras, advanced effects, and better slomotion"
"Ok so I really like this app, but I kinda hate it when it says my storage is full when I delete apps,photos, and it still says that. I really hate it when that happens. Also capcut needs to add graphs."
"It was nice at first, most of the features that were important in the app were free. As soon as the app got attention, everything costs money suddenly. I get it, devs need the money but like come on… It was the only app that was actually good to edit with because of its features. Now it’s all about money and not the users. Went from a 4/5 to a 2/5."
"Im honestly giving up on this app, for some reason when i use the clips i have at some point it ‘reaches it limit’ and than i can’t see anymore photos, I’d this continues i might delete..other than that the effects are pretty cool."
"This is an amazing app and definitely recommend it! It’s very easy to use and the end results are fabulous no matter what you do! ❤️ However, I wish there was a search bar for the music/audio in the video… 😩😒"
i don’t usually rate stuff but i’ve been using imovie mainly and it’s great and all but theirs more options on here plus it’s completely free and there’s no annoying logos and watermarks i recommended this to my friends great app
I really love this app it is my favorite editing app but the reason i didn’t give it 5 stars is bc of the “insufficient storage” i would really love if you remove it bc i add one picture and i can’t make an edit but besides that the app is really good
Amazing app great quality but it has one small problem which is Arabic/Kurdish language those two languages are not available so when i write in Arabic or Kurdish the letters separates if this app provides one of these two languages it would be amazing.
CapCut is an awesome tool! It has almost everything you need. The only think I’m not a big fan of is how much space is requires to save your videos. I will delete apps and old videos yet still not have enough to save a video.
"I’m a Gacha tuber and I do TikTok over roblox dances, since CapCut took away dreamy effects I can’t use the aura effects which I’m concerned about how am I able to edit without aura effect?? Can someone please explain to me how to fix this"
CapCut is a very good editor game but it keeps on saying I have to Many Photos in my camera roll but I don’t have that much and it doesn’t let me edit a video because it keeps saying that.
"I LOVE the app, it’s useful, free, all in one. It’s so amazing. It’s 1000% better than video leap or any other video editing app on the AppStore. You guys are so amazing. I wish you could add smooth key frames and add your own fonts! But it’s perfect"
I love making my videos on here and it makes me feel like a true editor for TikTok but on one of my videos it just stayed on 1 photo and my internet was on and working really well. And it just wont let me watch my other ones
"I used to be able to use this app with ease, then all of a sudden when I put a 7 minute video in the mix and scroll around to split it, it crashes. Basically saying, CapCut can’t handle big videos? Although I used to do the exact same thing and it didn’t crash."
Ngl: This is the BEST editing app I have ever used (and trust me I’ve tried a lot)! It’s 100% fee and no watermark! Plus it has so much cool features and other things most editing apps don’t have. Would totally recommend to anyone
"I wanted to make a edit on capcut and for a week now it’s been saying I have to many photos and projects so I deleted some projects, I now have like 3-5 . And I deleted some photos [around 2K +] and it’s still not working, I even deleted some videos and I have around 20 short videos now. It’s annoying me a lot and all my other editing apps are working but I wanna use capcut for this edit."
"I really like this app! It has a very good quality, and has NO watermark! But just one thing, I deleted so much photos but it says I need more storage. I try to make edits but it won’t work. Please try to fix that or tell me, what is wrong. But the app is still great!"
"This app is really amazing. The fact that it’s free is even better! I use it for all my edits, has really good animations and transitions! I love how you can take the watermark at the end away, 100% best editing app!"
Ok this app been good for editing and awesome but I wonder can y’all add edit key frames?? And like blur shake? And other things that Gonna be 10x times better not saying it’s bad or anything but I used it a lot and if you read this the ty
"Should definitely let people make their own effects also some of the effects are old, the valentines,Christmas,Halloween and other celebrities are horrible effects because it looks like it’s from tempo. I recommend this app but it needs more changes"
"I don’t like how when you have a certain amount of videos it says “clear up some space” and i delete some videos and clear my cache and it’s still saying that, can you fix this problem?"
"100 percent no water mark 
You have so much stickers tho please up date it with 
A moving background that will be really cool :D 5 stars! 
I have made perfect edits with gacha life and gacha club
Thanks for making the app your awesome"
It’s a really good app for editing! But when I’m trying to make edits that have fast clips the transition buttons always get in the way and it gets really annoying. The slow down could use some work as well. Overall good
I really like capcut but it would be cool if you added something like we could use other people’s overlays or something like that? And for the silver fish effect maybe make it without the streaks through it and just the wobble?
"Ive been searching around for a while for a good editing app, and this might be it!
I’m not a good editor, and I don’t even know how to use Cute Cut or VideoStar, but I’d recommend this to anyone who’s beginning to edit. 
All in all, it’s pretty epic."
I saw an ad for the app and decided to give it a try and it has been amazing. So make effects and it keeps yours your videos at it’s highest quality. No looking back!
"I use this for all my videos. It’s great. One suggestion though; could you add key frames to the video effects? Like when you add a blur effect, you can have it fade out using key frames."
Since the last update everytime I add a file imported audio file i cant head the sound please fix this big in the next update so i can continue using this great app thank you
"I really love capcut. Its easy to use and if you try hard enough you can make really good edits :)! The new feature where you can sync your TikTok audios into your edits is super useful!!  But I have a question..
What happened to the auto velocity feature?? I cant find “style” and I’m freaking out

I also have some suggestions:
-hue shift
-twitch shake effect
-screen float effect
-being able to “apply to all” on the speed of a video 

~^•Thats all from me. Bye! <3•^~"
i love capcut i have used it for a while now but i wish you could almost make it like vsp (Video Star Pro) but free. if yk what i mean . bc all their stuff cost money and it would also be cool to have a nice ghost effect.
"So i dont know what the graphs thing is when i use capcut and i dont have access to it💅😃. So if you are able to ✨contact ✨ me somehow and explain it i would love that 
P.S im writing this at 4:13am"
I can’t stand to CapCut pretty quickly it’s really fun and easy to use once you search up some stuff
Ok so I was using cc the other day and I had the border effect and I looked at it today cuz I wanted to make a edit it was GONE?! Maybe it’s a bug but please fix this. Other then that this app is amazing! But please get back to me soon.
"This is a great app for editors like me, but the one thing I wish we could do it add blend modes to the text, like you do with overlay. In the app you can add splice for your overlays but you can’t for text, I would love a function for that!"
"I honestly have no regret ever downloading the app, it has MANY features and is the best video editor app out of all the ones I’ve used so far. There is like literally no problems with it!"
"Like if you ever want a good editing app but without a watermark and it’s more easy to do transitions, cap cut is for you!  But the reason why I gave it 4 stars is because of the insane lack of bugs while your editing but over all its a good app."
So I love this edit app it’s very easy and great but the only problem with it that it always says to fix your storage I delete all my photos and videos but it dose not work who ever made CapCut can you fix this please?
"Cap cut is an amazing app that u like to edit on. But there are some parts that I don’t like, THE ONE I DONT LIKE IS THAT IT TAKEs up storage. And that’s it. Although it is an amazing app, I don’t really know how to animate bc it takes a bit for me to learn bc I am still learning and it is really hard how to do. BUT IT IS AN AMAZING APP SO BYEEEEEE"
I love Capcut but I wish we could be able to create custom 3d transitions/animations like a cube or a flip or let us be able to customize the preset animations. I would also like if we could add more than one of the animations on a clip.
I’m a beginner at editing and my bestie uses CapCut and she taught me how and I read the reviews and it turns out it’s really great! Like how they have music effects and a bunch more! It always helps me to edit!
"This app is really nice and I love it but, it keeps saying my storage is full but it’s not please fix this it’s so annoying how every time I power off my phone or click in to CapCut it says that nothing will work please fix this"
"Ok I love CapCut it’s a really easy way to edit videos and I love it so much but when the camera update came and it has filters with music, it worked for a min and when I exported it it won’t work anymore! I tried deleting it and adding it back but it still won’t work please fix this issue for me bc I love the filters btw! 🤍"
"I do recommend the app the Quality and the Way to edit is very easy! ( Unlike other apps ) U dont even need the tutorial U can figure it out easily!

There are a few bugs tho, Sometimes it glitches and freezes but i dont rlly mind it,But sometimes it takes a while for the effects to load

Although its an amazing editing app and 100% One of the best Apps!
So i do recommend downloading it!"
"I am a beginner editor, and this app makes it really easy! You can look up tutorials, but I do sometimes teach myself. After using it for a while you get used to it!"
"Look I have been making edits for like 3 or so years, and CapCut is wonderful! 
But it’s pretty outdated when it comes to newer edits! There is no 3 D edit stuff, but overall it’s pretty good <3"
"I absolutely live this app! Perfect for short videos or for beginner editors. I do have a suggestion though, maybe for the effects on the adjust tab, there could be keyframes for the effects. Just an idea but i think it'd be awesome."
"There is so many features! For Tiktok, I use capcut to make my videos. This app is so good 😊 ok I have a lot more to say but I don’t want to say.                          You can edit (obviously) and you have filters and you can make overlays, you can animate AND MUCH MORE THIS APP IS AMAZING"
CapCut is a really good app for me to make videos but there is a lot of bugs in the app because I was trying to add a text one time but the text wouldn’t show up on the screen so yeh.
"This app is great but kinda needs some help and updates 
I use this for most of my stuff its actually amazing tho 
I really love it and i think this is needs to add some more effects, 
Like : money falling , ok ty for your time"
"I love capcut. It’s great for editing. It’s just that right right now, I deleted bcz I have no storage, then re download it but it’s stuck on loading. It’s not even on my Home Screen. But other than that, this is awesome! And free!"
When I try to share a video it says I don’t have storage but when I go and look I do have storage and i reinstalled it I tried to make another video and the the video could not be made because capcut could not put the videos together so I reinstalled it again and it said I had too much built up storage but when I went to check I had storage left don’t download this app
i am so amazed at how many things you can do to your photos and videos with this app!! it’s so awesome to be able to edit your own album and doesn’t cost a penny. thank you!!
I’m new to editing and I love this app it’s perfect!! But I have 8 photos and 1 video and I still have no storage!! But I’m just asking if you could not put storage into the app it might help millions of people.
"With this app I’ve edited sooo good with all my other editing apps. They were a fail🙄, the only thing I would say to change it to change some sounds or add some more aesthic sounds. 💜, bye!! ☺️"
"Don’t get me wrong, it’s a good app but sadly I don’t like when even if I don’t have enough space and it needs to export it sadly won’t and once it took almost an hour to export and I was very sad because I had to do it almost a lot of times."
"So this is the only app I use to edit my edits but, it says I have to much storage but I on my have 1 video. And made me delete my edits all of it, so I'm not happy I tried redownloding it but doesn't work. Capcut if you see this can you probably tell me what to do?"
So I use cap cut for my edits for 1 year now and it’s great to use I have tik tok so I made my edits from cap cut and posted it on my tik tok account there are filters cool things to use make sure to get the app for some good edits if u have tik tok here’s a cap cut tip. Tip: learn some tricks
So here’s the thing I would like to experience what CapCut has to offer but how can I do that if I can’t import any media in the app like don’t get me wrong the app looks promising and it looks great I’ve read the reviews and was excited to use the app since I’m saving up for a computer so this would be my alternative for my edits but sheesh i think there’s some type of bug that need to be fix
"i don’t know why more people don’t use this app. it’s genuinely so good, has tons of features that are very easy to work with, easy to grasp editing techniques, and so much more. my only problem is the volume button as you cant really change the volume at all. it doesn’t increase or decrease even when you increase it all the way up or decrease all the way down. but other then volveu-me issues, it’s an amazing app that you should definitely check out! thanks to the creators as well!"
"Ohmygosh I just downloaded capcut and I love it already 😂😂 Everything is free which is great and its easy to make videos with. I dont have any negative comments, and I havent seen any problems yet. Keep up the good work! 👍"
Overall the app is really good but i want to ask if you can add an apply to all animation feature for photos because im tired of scrolling so much for multiple photos.😅
I love this app it’s truly amazing! But one problem is that recently I’ve been trying to use the effects and it keeps saying no internet connection why I’m on internet and every other app works
"I started editing just a few days ago and I’m obsessed. I love how CapCut makes it so easy to edit. Not only that, but if you practice hard enough it turns out amazing 👏 If I could give this a million stars I would."
One of the best editing apps I have ever used. No watermark and fantastic choices for effects and animation. I definitely recommend this app if you like to edit it’s really good and even simple to use. :)
This app is the best editing app ever!! No watermarks so I don’t have to crop out anything!! It took a little for me to figure it out but I also like how all of e effects are free!! Everyone should use this app you can overlay and add text!
It looks great it takes only a few minutes to figure out the controls and stuff and it looks great and no delay when you export.
"It’s so easy to use I learned how to use a green screen after I downloaded 
But I’m a gachatuber and I don’t know if it has somthing to tween I don’t know what to call it 
Ima call it buttons ;v; but can you add a tween button if there isn’t?"
"Turns out that your Video Editor can’t import audio in the video now, so that has to be fixed or making good videos with this thing may not work out anymore."
I was sure at first when I saw the add but it really has almost every video editing tool needed and I wouldn’t be surprised if they made it cost a few bucks soon
"so i have had this for 2+ days AND LOVE IT, its easy to use
No bugs (that i know of) and overall its just easy and simple.

note: if you are not an editor i suggest you learn a tad bit of editing first."
I love how every effect is free in the app unlike the other editing apps that ask you to pay so you can use other effects! The effects are high quality.😆
"If you could make like a select all for the videos so that I can easily edit it will be better, like zoom in the video and I have many videos it’s tiring to make it one by one so if you could do the ""apply to all"" it will be very helpful, beside that everything is perfect"
I prefer the old text shadows y’all had they looked clean I understand the new shadows you can change the directions and angles but make it separate I wanna be able to use the old shadow that was on the text before the angles were added
for the next update allow us to edit the animation and fonts for text templates. in addition release the new text animation as well
"It was NOT beginners luck at first , but the game wasn’t too bad ! It’s a really good app for beginners ! I recommend using cause this app has a lot of features to use when making videos !"
"Over all this is a really good app, but the style option just disappeared! I would very much appreciate if it came back😊"
So I’m beginner and I really like this app but the thing is I don’t like that I can’t pick my own songs like I can’t type in the song that I want that would really help if you add that thank you otherwise it’s a great app
I think the app is amazing but I think it should be put as 9+ because it isn’t inappropriate in anyway and it  could also increase downloads.
"i really like using this to edit things, but for some reason I can access the reverse option? Is it something that needs to be paid for? Cause for me, it’s just gray and I can not press it"
This app is super easy to use and has no glitches! Completely free and easy to make ticktock trends! Has quick velocity and has multiple effects! It’s super easy to use!
It would be so awesome if CapCut added some new transitions the app is so easy to use and I use every time I edit a video! But it would be so great if you add some new transitions and effects!
"Hello! I’m Margot, and I’m a gachatuber. Of you don’t know what that is, there is an app called gacha club that I use to make characters. CapCut is my go-to app when trying to animate, edit, and so much more!! I recommend CapCut to anyone"
This app is not just a Random app it is an amazing app! This is the first app I found text to speech on! No one can beat this app don’t know how people put four 3 2 or even 1 stars on this go download loaded at now! Also it’s free ;)
It’s amazing for like charli edits and stuff but I love how in the new update it’s like Vado on the speed when you speed it down I mostly Recommend this app for editing and if ur a starter look up stuff
"I love Capcut. It’s my first editing app, but I think it needs some work. I wish that Video Effects overlap the overlays and that you could merge the overlay into a selected part of the video it that’s not already in. But over all Capcut is a good app."
"This app is very user friendly and when I want to make an edit all I do is take screenshots, screen record, and upload it onto my project and boom all done! I love this app so much"
Okay... so I’ve had this app for a year and so there is this problem where it keeps saying “can’t import video try again later” or something like that right? And then I updated thinking ya would fix it AND delete some of my storage but then it still did the same thing..... I don’t know what is happening? Pls help 😕
Love this app.. it’s just that recently it became a little buggy… now after I remove my background.. I no longer have the option to upload a different background other than that.. it’s great
So basically I wanna make a video but it keeps needing something from my settings so I delete the app to try and make it better but now all my videos are gone AND I CANT MAKE VIDEOS STILL so now my channel is probably going to die
You should think about it adding sound to camera so you can make dancing videos without having to edit then over with the sound but overall I love this app
"It is good and it's free but I was making an edit with a lot of clips and it was a really insane sort of edit. Basically when I was making it, the edit was glitching like crazy and it just stopped working and it just deleted my entire edit."
this game is so fun i hardly play any of my other games with this one i love it. i honestly think people should get this and the best thing-ITS FREE!!! I can send my edits to whoever i choose and i can make any kind of edit i want. AMAZING!
"I was just spinning the video with keyframes and suddenly at some times it just starts moving by itself??? I wasn't even touching the screen at all and it just starts moving randomly. It went up and down, zoomed in and out??"
"I love this app so much, I make Gacha Club videos on it and it is so good to use!! It’s free and it’s so easy. I swear, out of like 60 editing apps that I have tried over the years, this one is the most easiest and the best one I have ever used. CapCut is awesome. ✋🏻"
"So I love using capcut, But theres 2 complaints id like to add. Like the quality, When I zoom my screen recorded videos in, It has bad quality, and a little glichy. And when I want to add a smooth slow-mo, Its alwsys rough, and It pauses the videos to make it look slow. I love the app but,you should fix these!"
"I think this app is awesome, it’s easy to use and great for beginners and experts it loads quickly and so many cool features of your having some trouble editing you should use this app!"
The first day I learn how to edit was I think the 12th day! For YT on Gacha life! The only thing I hate is when you need more storage and if u have too much storage then it won’t let you bc it anymore was full-
"Honestly capcut is the one of the best editing app theirs so many edits I see on tiktok and it’s on Fleek cap is just amazing I use this for most of my editing videos and you can do 
Velocity you can even put your own sound"
"Hello! I love, making gacha videos, for my friends. And it has the best stuff for me to make, storys, Music videos, and much more! Even real life stuff to! I recommend getting this app, :DDD, but one more thing- the premium is a lot of money sadly, but i do love this app, my mum, likes my edit!"
So when I make an edit sometimes it always say that I have to much storage but I don’t so I want that to be fixed but besides that I really like the app ! It’s helpful a lot and I do suggest actually getting the app ✨
This app is so amazing and so easy to learn! You can do so many different things and you learn more as you go. There are super cool features and I hope to be seeing more soon!!!
This has horrible glitches and unfixable when you try to adjust the filter it does not work it goes to half of its brightness etc lots of times it disconnects and lags out creators please fix this app I might want to quit just because all these bugs it’s honestly so annoying and just makes me mad not much good effects and can not do much with this don’t get this
I have always tried different editing apps and i didn’t like them and they were not easy to use but then i found the app capcut and i loved it instantly. #best editing app ever!
Absolutely love this app and all it’s features especially that it’s free! Although after the last update the auto captions doesn’t seem to be working. Please fix! 😊❤️
So when I first downloaded this I didn’t know what to do but when I found out what I can do on here I was amazed I all of a sudden loved this app so much and I still do your amazing thx
"Ever since the update a few weeks ago, the auto captions feature doesn’t work. It keeps telling me to try again later. The main reason I used this app was for the auto caption feature."
I’ve been using CapCut for a while now but today something happened.  I was working on an edit for tik tok when it changed all of my text to have these white backgrounds. IT CHANGED THEM ON ALL OF MY EDITS. Some of these edits took hours and now are ruined. This was a really good app but this has made me hate it. And I literally cannot find a way to find it. 😡
The app is amazing but maybe can use more effects and more spaces for overlays tried making something with a lot of overlays but not that much spaces for overlays but overall the app is amazing!! My edits are good tho
"Capcut is really great but when i try to go in my edits it will stay still for a moment and i have to figure it out,it glitches,but over all pretty underrated and i hope you have a great time! Thank you for reading mine"
"this app is very good for pre-made transitions and more. If your looking for a app that u can make your own transitions with, sadly this app won’t work. But it does help with combining photos & videos and using cool effects."
"I spent 3 hours trying to do an edit and I had to start all over again so then I spent 5 hours remaking it then,  Capcut stated to lag out and now all the videos that I made are all gone. Capcut please try to fix this, I don't know if it is my phone but over all you are a good video editor.🙂"
"the first time i used this app was yesterday and it worked perfectly fine but im was trying to edit today but it kept freezing and lagging and i couldn’t see if the transition worked or not cause it was frozen and the only was i could check is if i downloaded the video and the videos take up a lot of space, soooo whoever made CapCut please fix these bugs and lags please thank you. 😟😟"
CapCut is my favorite app to use for editing video. It’s really easy and simple. One thing about it though is that it kicks me out of the app a lot but that might just be my phone. But this is most definitely one of my favorite apps to use!
"I love CapCut so much! It’s the best video editor i’ve ever seen! the only thing is that when i download a font to it, i don’t know where to find it! i looked at text and it wasn’t there and i kept checking and it’s not there."
"THIS IS SUCH A GOOD APP!!! the edits on this app are amazing, it’s free and doesn’t have a watermark. Genuinely amazing, all though. When applying effects I wish there was a “most used” or “recent” feature, that way I could apply effects easier"
"Not only does it have no watermark and pretty much has everything free, after awhile, it gets super easy to use! I’m really happy my boyfriend recommended me this app :) super helpful for editing videos!"
Everything is amazing just when I want to do an auto velocity I can’t because it takes so long it starts at 25% and takes 2 minutes to go to the next percentage please fix this.
This app is the best super easy to use you don't need to pay a lot of money just to get a certain tool not like in other app all the things you need for video editing is here.
This app is very helpful but this past few hours I have been trying to click on the effects and the stickers button and it is not letting me What should I do? I restarted my phone and even deleted the app and redown loaded it again and it still won’t let me edit and add effects and stuff pls help if anyone knows anything pls respond back
The app is really good I love editing with it but if I edit it with it the videos get laggy and messy which just ruins the whole thing so you can’t actually edit much or the video will turn out to be a mess. Like what happened to me I spent 4 hours on a video and it turned out VERY laggy so now I’m very upset because I thought this was a  good app please fix this I’m crying
"Hey, Ive notice that when I finished editing, everything was on beat until i go into my photos and everything is just a bit late. This made me upset and made me work for minutes trying to get it on beat. Can you please fix this?"
"Most of the editors need more transitions, it’s an issue because we are trying to make different things but I can’t. Please add more and better transitions."
"The style button is gone, and prior to that I always had it, but now I’m trying to make an edit and I go check and there is nothing there that pertains or even is the style, I tried searching and only a few have been noticing it."
I’m a new editor Check me out XeditA but anyways add Auto save I was editing for 2 hours and lost all of it because my iPad died and it didn’t save the effects so make it where effects are saved
I really like this app and it’s very easy and I’m loving the new update they did with their app. But honestly maybe some 3D stuff would really make the app so much better.
"Capcut is an anazing app! It is free and provides everything you could get in paid apps. But, it glitches saying my storage is full, I check and it’s not. This means I have to delete the app over and over again because if I try updating it, doesn’t do anything. Really annoys me."
"I made a lot of good edits with capcut, amazing app. I think that this app is the best app i have used yet because alot of editing apps cost money for alot of effects, and has ads, capcut is 100% free and has no ads."
It’s so good for beginners and I use this all the time but skipping to the part I dislike is that it takes up like 1gb for a single video and my iPad only has 32gb so I just delete the app and re download it but still please fix this
This app is very nice and easy to use! I have used this app many times and it is so amazing! I love being able to put music over my videos and putting transitions!
This is a very great app for beginners because you can access things really easily and very compact. I have started using this with great confidence. This is very well for a iPad and phone.
Hello! This app is amazing for my edits! Love it. But can u add something that would be very useful? I just deleted an edit I did and I worked on it for an hour and i deleted it by mistake.  Can u please add “ See deleted projects” and u will see the edits u deleted and u can recover them.  Thank u so much. It would really mean a lot! Bye
I’ve been using CapCut forever to edit vids and post them on social media. There are so many cool effects and options for everyone. I highly recommend.
It’s really a good app but there is one thing that I hate so sometimes when I’m working on some videos and it’s like 4-5 mins it lags badly and skips some parts overall good app!
"This is great for beginners! It’s also SUPER easy to use! 
but there should by a beginners guide when you start. I had no clue what to do when I got this I would like this to get a developer response but great app tho!"
My You better try to make a movie but he said it was too hard and I think we’re gonna make it like a little bit more easy to edit the videos and graphics trash not even that good and I think that they should add 4K cameras there because honestly it’s not a very good quality movie maker I think that you guys should add that you guys should add more than you should
"It’s a good app, has good features and good quality (and I might only be doing one star cause I’m mad), but when I was trying to make an edit the timing was OFF. Every time I saved it was one second less and the audio was late. No matter what I did it still didn’t work, and obviously with the sound off it’s not gonna be good. So can you guys fix your app please like you’re my #1 editing app so… yeah."
Capcut is the best!!! It is completely FREE!!1!1!1 I would say to download this app! It is very good editing app and it is amazing to use. A lot of people use this app so why not get it if you don’t have it! Just saying in my opinion.
"i love this app and im glad i got it because its one of the best editing apps EVER
but why do the tiktok audios never work for me ummm like i have a lot of favorited audios and obviously an account so why does it say network error…im on wifi and the connection works uh"
I like CapCut the only thing that I don’t really like is how the remove background isn’t that good I’m trying to make a edit but chroma key and remove background don’t work it’s just removes like half of the character
"This thing make no sense with storage
Especially for gacha makers!
Every time I make something it will say at least seventeen times “Inefficient storage” PER PROJECT
I screenshot to much so the five apps I deleted did NOTHING 
The ONLY TWO reasons I don’t use another app is because it’s simple but looks good and you can delete the watermark"
Ok so I do love the app it’s really good for beginners but the thing is it is asking me to allow me to access saving videos and so I can make videos because I already let them access that CapCut plz fix it if it is a bug or something
"When I join the app, sometimes it wont let me click a project, if the developers read this please fix the problem."
I love capcut!! But there are ALOT of issues!! 1. I get this weird whirl when I try to edit snd its very annoying 2. When Im adding overlays My previous clip gets all blurry 3. It deletes my text when ever I add numbers!! And more. If you guys could fix this it would be awesome!!
The problem is it says I can’t export my video because I have a bunch of storage but the truth is I deleted all my photos and videos on my gallery and 8 of my apps that I don’t use anymore and now you guys are saying I have a bunch of storage? Ugh it’s not fair but it’s a good app
"10/10 love this app, only thing is that I did need to look up to do stuff, although I thought so but I started editing here and now I use other apps but I use this app mainly"
Is there anyway I can get my old videos because I accidentally deleted cap cut and I read downloaded it and now I can’t get my other videos please help if you can
"When I started using this app, I never went back to any other ones. He has everything including text customization, great animation, and many wonderful video effects! 

However I would like to be able to pin different edits onto the main clip so it sticks to it. So when I drag the clip to a different spot all the edits under it will stick to it! 

Please add this feature! 
This is truly a amazing editing app!
Thank You!"
The app is amazing except for the “clean up storage” button when I go to make a new edit.I had to delete almost all my photos just to make a edit that is 12 seconds long.😐Other then that the app is pretty good.
So I have been using this app for about an hour or two so far and I noticed that I cannot move the text around when I tried once. It is annoying. Please fix this bug.
"This app is AMAZING. when they have updates, they also turn out good. It’s super easy to edit and the edits are usually good! For me, I like editing things, if they turn out bad, that’s just because of me. Overall, IM OBSESSED!"
This app is so great! I’m never ever going to use a different editing app! One recommendation is that you if we can get an option if the effect will show on overlay! Otherwise I love this app!
"This app is a really good app for
Beginners and even I started on it I now edit on alight motion but if you just started editing or you want to just have fun download this app is also can remove the watermark of alight motion"
"This app is totally worth downloading it 
I give it 5 stars . And everything is 100% free and there is no watermark ! U can but multiple layers and thousands of free stickers and a lot of effects and filters this is the best app for editing !🫀"
Dont get me wrong I love this app! But I have a suggestion. When you put a transition and crop it a lot I think maybe the transition should stay so you don’t have to go every video having to put the same transition. Overall a good app! ✨
"Don’t get me wrong here but this app is amazing! The only thing I hate is that when you put your overlay on your video it goes up front. In my opinion, there should be a choice so you can have the overlay up front or the back."
"I love this, but it’s hard to rotate stuff without resizing it, so it would be nice if the was a feature where you can choose if you’re rotating an image or resizing an image."
"There’s no watermark and you can literally take out the ending!!! And when you add a sound, you can use videos!!!!!!! it’s amazing!!! I’ve been using KineMaster this whole time, but this app is way better! (And yes I’m not a bot- ;-;)"
"I’m a youtuber and I edit videos a lot. This app makes my videos very nicely done but it takes up a lot of my storage, therefore I had to delete it. It’s a good app but it isn’t good if your running out of storage. It’s amazing for edits though! 
Sub to me Sasa Belle 
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
It’s great but I’m working on an edit an I have to keep going back to “Distort Right and I have to do that to over 50 photos☹️ So can you add something when you can add animations to favorites so it’s easier for everyone?
"This app gives you no water mark, has tons of features you can use, and overall, pretty easy to navigate. This totally deserves a five star rating"
"Literally the best editing app I’d had so far, but could be so much more better if they had a drawing tool! They have audio, effects, stickers, but no draw? Come on now man!"
"The best editing app I’ve ever used! I’m really proud of what I’ve made with it! The controls can be difficult for one to use if you aren’t already used to editing software, I got the hang of it pretty fast"
So this app is overall REALLY good so the only complaint I have is not having a graph for the key frames to change the speed if CapCut could add that it would be incredible
This app is soooo easy to use. I really enjoy editing randomly and this is the best app I’ve found. There are so many great features. I made a commercial for school with this and it turned out AMAZING.
So I bought this and Video star (year pro). I expected the video star to be better but I tried this and. WOW! I love them both so much! If you are looking for a free editing app with no watermark then this is the app for you!
I’m not sure if y’all added a update or something but when I try to edit it lags ALOT I mean ALOT and don’t get me wrong this app and is best it’s just idk if it’s the app that’s making my edits lag
"I love the app but you could add a few more mask and maybe better intros, like the spinning top but maybe take off the spinning part it would look way better"
"basically what the title thing is. u should let us have an account so we have all our edits&drafts on different devices. bc i have capcut on my phone and ipad and the edits are not the same so it’s frustrating. it also has become a little laggy recently..? please fix this, also please add smoother transitions!! like simple but smooth!! so please stop the lagginess, allow us to make an account and sign in w it to multiple devices, and add smoother simple transitions"
I’ve just started using this editor it was good until I started to use overlays. Once I went to use overlays it wouldn’t appear on screen or that it was onscreen but it wouldn’t let me move it. There was just a green box I was moving. And every time I do it and put the overlay in the video I can’t see it in the video. I expected better.
"It’s good. Has a lot of cool features that you could use in a video. Unlike most apps, they have transitions you can use for free. However there’s a problem. When you use too much videos, the app will lag and not load the video properly. Overall the app is very good."
I love this app I’ve been looking for something with no water mark and great effects and transitions the only this is when I put two effects it Glitches also when I have transitions on my photos and make the photos shorter then transition don't work that’s all😊
"hii!|I been using this app to make edits I haven’t used this for to long.I’m trying to get the velocity thing but I can’t see style?whatever I do which is Update,Go back Etc it can’t work! Can u tell me what’s wrong?"
"I love this app for the fonts and the slow motion, but please bring back the style button for the velocity please. i used this app for my edits a lot i really like this editing app . Please bring it back 💕"
"This is an amazing app! There are some problems tho :(
first of all
1) when i am making a video, and adding and overlay, it always says i don’t have any photos in my gallery,
i’ve tried uninstalling it so many time and the reinstalling it but nothing, all i have to do is exit the app but it’s so annoying!
2) I have to flip the screen around even when screen rotate is turned off, this used to not happen but it’s getting very annoying now.

that’s all! <333"
"I made a video, it was 1 hour but I shortened it to 10 minutes so I’m almost done with it but I added one more thing to the video and it just started flashing and stuff. It moved all my edits around and now I’m just so mad because not only did it move the edits around by itself but it deleted some stuff by its self too like ugh!!"
It’s not bad it’s just that whenever you use the sound and if you want to add a photo it won’t let you so you have to refresh but I like the app because It helps me a lot when I want to edit
"With this new Smooth Slow Motion update, whenever it processes it gives me a totally random clip in the video. It’s okay since it’s a new feature but I just want to let you guys know if it can be fixed."
"I just redownloaded CapCut today and when I tried to edit a video and it was too laggy and CapCut never used to be this laggy. I am on iOS 15.4.1 and there is nothing wrong with my phone. Until the tech team fixes this problem , three stars for now."
CapCut’s amazing but I wish it had a display model though it would’ve been cool if you get this could you make another update about it that would be cool but this app is really amazing though 😊❤️
I really enjoy editing my videos  it’s really easy to edit vids on this app I really recommend using this app before using other editing apps!
I’ve many people showing how they click style and then the velocity option and the video is automatically edited but I don’t have that option I’ve tried updating twice now and I still don’t have the option :(
Hi I really like this app! It’s great for editors that want to use effects on their videos. I just have a small question. Why do I only have 3 options in “Style”? I’ve seen people have many options in “Style” but I’m wondering why I don’t have them.
I saw that capcut had a update and when I updated it nothing changed. I saw that people got like velocity and stuff but I didn’t. Maybe it don’t work for iPhones 🤔
I love this app so much I make all my Gacha vids with it I have this a five star my friend has it there’s no adds so that’s good I been looking for a  app like this for a long time tysm for making it😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄
Cap cut it completely free and has more options and is easier to use than things like splice which cost a subscription
This is very good for beginners Of Editing! But for the audio it barely work like you can’t cut it properly so that needs some work but this is a very good app for beginners and I’m still using Bc imma beginner also!
"It’s a good app but cmon with the “no internet connection” when i try to use my tiktok sounds. I’ve had to delete it like 3 times. Get it together and fix that. It’s nothing on my end it’s the app. It’ll work one second then gone the next, that’s really irritating!!"
Don’t get me wrong I love the app but the way I constant have to delete my other edits to make new ones is very old and annoying. I hate the way that it also keeps telling me my story are is full also. But I recommend this for beginners!
"Hi again!💛 PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE! Add shakes like videostar, not the EXACT same but similar please! Make us be able to design our own fonts through the app, and PLEASE overlays like videostar.  Like ae screen float, etc. more like video star to improve better and it will be free! Itll help me alot like if you add more like videostar shake effects and more💛 xoxo camila"
There’s a spot where I delete a lot of my videos in my camera and it didn’t it and it still said that there’s not enough space can you please fix this bug?
"This app is amazing for beginner editors wanting to get started making TikTok's and videos. There is huge libraries of effects, filters, sounds, etc. I definitely recommend CapCut for people looking for a free editing app!"
its an amazing app this review is gonna be short bc im lazy even when i have nothing to do so um yeah its 100% free app you can remove water mark for FREE!!!!! Its amazing the  effects are good theres so much options and its rlly great f9r beginners amazing overall all amazing
So once I exported my edit I realized that the video and the audio weren’t in sync and this has happened a few times now. So I’m just hoping you’ll fix that soon. :)
Before I was horrible making edits with CapCut then when I actually used more effects it became more helpful and easier for me!Definitely recommend this app it helps❤️
I got this app when I hadn’t done anything with videos or editing. Now I can make some pretty cool videos. Easy to add audio and texts definitely would recommend 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
"As an editor, I personally love CapCut! It can do a lot of things especially make great edits. It also has great filters and effects that make the edits better! Overall it’s a 5 out of 5"
I love this game and nothin wrong with it accept I can’t seem to find the right music I can only get different songs and not the ones I want but other than that everything is fine ty❤️😅
I love it i love using it but i would like more transitions like short cuts have a lot of transition but there not original edits so I would like more transitions to make the edits even better! Other than that a amazing app I definitely recommend it!
"Alr so Basically there’s just this one glitch where if you add a key frame it doesn’t put it where you have the white line 

(Would Be 4.5 stars chz its not bad @ all its just the glitch)"
"I love this app but you guys change something about the overlay, and now it’s too slow and too choppy when I’m trying to make key frames. Please reverted back thank you."
"CapCut is an amazing video editor I love all the stuff you can do for free I recommend this if your looking for a free video editing software, I’ve seen people do ROBLOX edits with CapCut and it looks incredible keep up the amazing work"
This app is so amazing everything is free you can make whatever you want to make the effects are so amazing I have been using them a lot! This app is so amazing so I recommend it
"I love CapCut. It is an amazing app, I have started to edit most of my stuff there. Plus, unlike other apps, u don’t have the watermark 😩👍 and u can get rid of the end if u want. CapCut is underrated in my opinion"
This app is amazing no adds no watermark 100% free nothing wrong with it but if your storage gets full it won’t let you use the app but otherwise this app is AMAZING totally recommend its great for editing its just amazing!!!
"this app is so amazing, you can do anything and everything is completely FREE! you can do all sorts of things like advanced transitions, text effects, etc. i HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APP for anyone who wants an advanced video editor."
"I think that CapCut has many amazing features. For example, many cool effects and editing options. Sometimes this app can be VERY laggy and it’s hard to edit. For example, the audio might be glitching or the editing process might be very laggy. In rest this app is really good for editing!"
"One word, wow. This...is...SO...AMAZING...
I downloaded it for just one edit, but now ill use it for ALL my edits! This is even better than Videoshop, ill delete it right now! It has every feature of Videoshop, but better! (No offense.)This is great! Keep it up!"
"Everything is great, like people have listed but I really want to be able to make videos even with full storage, and be able to review/edit my videos with full storage. Thanks!"
This is absolutely amazing you need it right now you can basically edit videos or make videos this thing is absolutely amazing I totally recommend
I love this app so much i use it all the time the only thing is that i think you should be able to search for Music but other than that its amazing and totally beginer friendly.❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤🤍🤎
"I enjoy this App No water marks. It’s extremely helpful for me editing my videos musics and Quick trailers! I would recommend this app to anyone wanting to edit, without any problems."
This is a very great app But I have. A request I’ve been looking on Yt And I thought if you could add hayloft edits I’ve always wanted to do one and they seem very fun! Just asking if you could maybe add that!
"I really love this app...
My reasons why:
The transitions aren’t corny and actual look good.
There are so many cool stickers.
They gave a text to speech option which is very cool and useful.
So many cool effects.
Your able to make the quality of a video/picture very good.
IT’S FREE A NICE WELL DONE APP FOR FREE!!!
You guys should keep it that way.😉 /hj
I do have a suggestion tho...could you guys maybe consider adding graphs to key frames? It’s totally ok if you guys don’t I just think it would be cool.🤔"
I love the app so much the only thing I don’t like is that it freezes sometimes when I’m trying to edit like the video itself freezes:( but overall I love the app!:))
This is by far the best editing app out there. there are hundreds of filters and transitions that are all free which give the app great quality. 10/10 would recommend! Great for beginners!
I have made an amazing edit it took exactly 30 minutes to make! And right when im about to post it a big glitch stops the video from going on. It freezes and wont let you watch the rest. Terrible app this app disgusts me for the fact of it ALWAYS freezing. Thanks for wasting my time on your stupid app capcut.
This app is really good for making edits for tiktok but Im having an issue. Sometimes when im clicking an effect it’s saying I have k internet connection when I do. Can someone fix this?
"First off love the app works amazing 

Just wish it had better transitions for it other wise i love it because I edit a lot for my fan accounts would definitely recommend for first time editors who are wanting to learn about editing stuff :)  

I’m glad that it has a free use option for every transitions for beginners"
"I’ve never been so happy with an app like this one it’s the best, it’s easy to use, has a lot of options you can use, and the best part it’s free!!! I don’t regret downloading this app at all😁"
Ok so there are so many things I love abou th is app it's just the RBI no tutorials of how to do so you just have to figur it out your self and picking where you want the to start and the transitions are very challenging but otherwise great app : )
You help so many pepole achieve there dream on editing and become TikTok famous you help me do my stuff on here even my friends love it I use it for everything every day Tysm for making this an app
"Luv this. Very good for beginner editors, but I was making some stuff and switched my camera around, tried to turn it back and it wouldn’t change back to front camera. Please fix this!

                       -me"
"I make all my Tik toks on CapCut, and it’s so easy to learn how to use. You can make amazing videos on your phone by simply using CapCut. This app being free is truly incredible and I absolutely love it."
I am connected to internet I was doing an edit when it just wouldn’t let me use it! It said “try again your not connected to internet.” I refreshed and everything! And it lets me upload certain photos but not the ones I need to! So I deleted the app it still didn’t work. Now all my things are gone and y’all lazy behinds have a broken app. It’s not working!
"So sometimes when I need to add a overlay all my pictures disappears and says I have no photo in here but I DO! 
When I also add a audio and leave the app just a moment and came back and the sound is like in HALF! Please fix these it keeps happening to me."
This editing app is 100% better than any editing app you will ever come across. I’m not even joking. IT HAS EVERYTHING! you will have so much more fun if you explore all the things possible on the app! AWESOME!
"This app is amazing! Especially with the new velocity feature! There's just one small problem. Whenever I try to add graps, it glitches out and doesn't look very clean."
Am I only getting the problem with not getting my TikTok audio favorite saved files? Everything else is great but I would hate to do the trick to download manually for the audio and extract. Help.
There’s not that much space to do lots of edits and the app is great just give us more storage to use I have 1 video and it’s not letting me do anymore it’s stupid
I love the app and it’s easy to do transitions but it doesn’t give me a very big music range I would love if you could make a area for people to search up music instead of having to pull it out of videos
I’ve started capcut about a year ago and it’s been the best decision I told all my cousins about it and we all mastered it completely ive tried other apps but nothing could beat calcut.
So I am a very successful YouTuber with horses and I have lots of trouble trying to make my videos on my channel. I came across Cap Cut and I thought i was living in a dream! It is amazing and I totally recommend this app
It’s super easy to use you don’t have to pay it’s completely free no memberships no adds it’s great for me to edit videos for friends and you can use it on the go
Some effects don’t work and can i request music onto the camera part and i would like it if you could preview the video before it automatically saves
"What regions do you have to be in to use templates i just wanna know because i could use a VPN to access the template feature sorry if this is a bother
Bye."
Okay I love this app but I have a compliant… when trying to tween it gets upsetting because when I’m working on the head it won’t turn which gets me really upset.. but this app is amazing! It has lots of cool affects and stuff like that.
I would say this app is very good but there one thing that I think needs to be fix so when I put an effect it shortens my video and it’s really annoying to adjust each snap of a video
And I revealed is 10 stars it’s just great it’s so easy to edit I get views that for me it in a blow up so you know I like this
"Hi, my capcut is broken and I don’t know what to do but I always have to close the app and go in again. Please fix the data lost glitch thing or bug. It happened to me multiple times."
I just get this app not too long ago and I have noticed that whenever I go to add auto captions it says to create auto captions turn ur volume down. I can only add auto captions by voiceover and it won’t let me change them to original sound. I have heard many amazing things about this app but I am very disappointed.
I like this app! Easy to use but also give me a challenge like key frames and all that. I just hate that I have more than enough storage but the app says I need more and I can’t delete anything because of school apps and that stuff. And NO WATERMARK WHILE EDITING THANK GOD!
The app is good I love it and I love editing on there but I which when I do the camera focus thing we can have key frames so the blur and go faster but love the app
My suggested I get this app and have not played it but it seems great and it seems like they worked really hard to make this so good work for the people who made this!💖
"personally, i kinda wish there was graphs to go along with keyframes. this way it could balance out everything between selecting transitions and making your own. i also think there should be more glitch/eyestrain filters. maybe ones that flash faster with more colors? and ones that flash and follow the outline of a picture? i like the app, but it just needs some tweaking."
CapCut is good for editing but it’s 1 issue I’m dealing with. When I try to edit it says “Insufficient storage. Clean up some phone storage and try again” So I cannot get my videos if that keeps happening and I can’t edit with it. I hope it gets fixed soon
"This app is underrated, it’s amazing my edits look professional! You don’t have to pay anything for anything! No money , no credit cards, and most of all this app is really easy to use! , , OmG! There amazing!"
"This app is so great and easy to use!!! There are so many cool stickers, music, and transitions!!! This is SO much better than KineMaster!!!! I HIGHLY suggest this for Gacha tubers!!! I am so happy I downloaded this app! I hope you all will enjoy it as much as I do! :]"
This apo is amsing all my friends have been using this so tried it out and it was just what I needed but the music there should be more and maybe a serch bar cuz I’m looking for a spasifc song but I can’t find it
"I love CapCut for many reasons,
1. easy to edit with
2. fast uploading then most apps
3. it helps A LOT!
4. no watermarks 
but……
The amount of bugs it can have is crazy,
I have been using cap cut for 2 years now
And 2022 has to be the worst the bugs have been. 
Weather it’s not loading, glitching to much as I play the video or just exiting out of the app.
I’m not trying to complain these are easy bug fixes. Cap Cut is a Great editing app to use for beginners and professionals. Totally Recommend!"
"This app is 100% gold good bc I use this when I edit on TikTok and others, it's one of the easiest editing apps to use and I got pretty good at editing on this app. It also has NO watermark? This is amazing thank u so much, btw me TikTok is  koopico 💀🔫"
I love this app because it’s 100% free and there’s no watermark. It’s fairly easy to use and after awhile it becomes simple to make amazing and complex edits! If you are new to editing I would totally suggest using capcut
Its the besssssttttttttt if you want to know abaut the app like yea its the best editing app and its only 172mb like if you are like me and wach the reviews before you instal a app then just know this app is the one it thosent have a watermark likeeee dooooodddd i love it so yea.!!!!!
But sometimes when I’m trying to use the bling it won’t let me and I’m connected to the internet and it still wouldn’t work? can you fix that?
"Please never change 🥺 this is such an amazing app, no in-app purchases, REALLY easy to edit unlike other apps. I’m so glad this app exists! I’ve been using it so much to edit clips for my gaming account, I’m so in loveee 💕"
So I recently used the style button for some edits I was making but I noticed that now it’s missing. I can’t use the auto velocity anymore. I don’t know if it’s a glitch or it was simply just removed but I do hope it comes back
"Sooo uhh, sometimes when I exit one of my projects some of it isn’t saved, its kinda annoying especially when I put effort into a small part. Please consider fixing it :)"
"This is such an amazing app I do very much recommend but the connection doesn’t work even though it is on, and other apps work pls help I love this app."
"Its really great app and has so much usefull tools but i have one problem which it doesnt keeps the video's original quality and its become little blurry or not clear when i save it and copmare it with the original video there 
is a diffrence in quality"
"I absolutely love the app! I’m a beginner and I’m just starting to create reels, and CapCut made them a hundred times better. It has many features and it’s easy to use."
I love capcut so much it such a good way to make good edits but I accidentally deleted a video that I made for an edit and I wish CapCut had a way if you delete a video on accident you could recover it so CapCut please add something like this
I use CapCut for anime edits and they are amazing. 👍 It’s simple so I’m not confused on how to make the edits so good :D.If you would like to edit and looking through the reviews to download CapCut you should definitely try it.
"So I really love capcut, it is my main editing app! However, I can’t get the update. So could you reply and help me out with that please? I would really appreciate it. <3"
"I like it because it’s simple and easy to use. It just needs more stuff. like music, more stuff to edit the videos? That’s all I can come up with.."
"This editing app is great for effect and filters and more, I would recommend it 🤩! It is also easy to use it’s not confusing and it’s just simple and great!"
Everytime I go on CapCut I click it and it says storage full🙄 I delete so much storage and it still says it’s full and that is really annoying but overall the app is okay some bug fixes and it’s a bit laggy sometimes but I still like it tho it’s very good for beginners there’s just some bug fixes yall need to fix
This is literally the easiest and best editor I’ve found and have been using it for months and making countless videos. 5 stars
This is such a good video editor for a novice like me because it’s so easy to use and get the hang of 10/10 I wish I would have come across this app sooner! :)
"CapCut is a great app for beginners and for people who use it a lot. Makes them look like there using videostar! But, the one thing I’m asking is that u fix ur slow mos. there very low quality, but other then that it’s a awesome app."
"So far the best Video editor app I have used! 
I Was using iMovie, DJI mimo, Quick, but this app is the most user friendly, straight forward features that you  an use with no hassle!"
I was looking for an app to make gacha videos the first app I found was KineMaster it was really hard to get use to then I found capcut I got use to it in a minute I will never stop using capcut
"This is an amazing app!! I love it! You can do so much, and it’s perfect. The only thing is, It keeps telling me to delete some of my videos, I don’t know why! Do you know if this can be fixed? But other then that, great app!"
i love capcut so much its a really good app you can do so much with it just theres a few things that i would want to fix first of all i wish there was a undo button so if you make a mistake u can just undo it second of all when i never add a sound or a song or anything like that when im done with my video and i watch it theres a song that i didnt add but other than that its a really great app
This app is so good someone made the off-brand version of it and it’s called vita like 😤👌 this app is so underrated it’s awesome and so easy ❤️ I make tons of videos on it (check out my yt channel! Just search up aizen 😁)
I’m a big editor with a yt channel (welcome to camp ash pls sub🥲) I love how easy the app is. But there is some critiques I have to give. I constantly have to delete a bunch of things from my camera role etc. It gets annoying when I have 2 thing Ian my library and it says out of memory.
Not sure why but recently when I save a video the quality because absolute garbage even though the picture quality is as high as I can possibly have it from the source and on the app and it’s pretty annoying
"Hello. I have using CapCut for the fast few months. I think the app is amazing for beginners/intermediate editors. However, I have a suggestion. I think that you should add graphs. Add it to clips, keyframes, and other things. Apart from that, The app is amazing.                         Thanks! -AmazingRG"
"I started making edits not too long ago, and everything was great. I could edit as much as I wanted. I added the new update to the app, and I can’t access any of my  previous edits anymore. I’ve been trying to install the “update” it needs so I can just open it, but it never works."
It’s fun and it’s a good way to pass time me and my friend send videos and I love the tools you can use but can u add anime pictures because I love going anime edits and it’s great for Gacha life ☁️ and I hope you have a good day or afternoon or Night
"This app is amazing! I’ve been looking for a good editing app, and this is definitely the one; it’s 100% free, no watermark, and the features it has are really cool! I definitely recommend, 10/10!"
"Love CapCut so much I definitely recommend it, it’s just that sometimes I can’t move or delete text and I sometimes cant import new things and have to wait"
I tried to make anything but then it saying I don't have enough storage so I delete the one movie I made and then it's still saying I have no storage and then I go to delete some of my photos didn't work so I tried deleting it was downloading it didn't work I tried to go maybe make it again didn't work then I deleted all my tabs didn't work so now I don't know what to do?
"there is no other editing app out there that is as awesome as this! You don’t have to pay for edits, in fact, you don’t have to pay for anything! Very cool! 😎"
Don’t get me wrong this is an AMAZING app but I keep having my phone freeze and play the music when I am off the app and It kept freezing so I couldn’t see my screen other than that it is a really good app
works great everything is fine but it keeps saying insignificant storage I have like 10 pictures and 2 videos in my camera roll so I don’t see how I have significant storage
"hey man uh i’m having problems with capcut; 
im trying to like make an edit but, it says to confirm so i did but it sent me to my settings? i don’t know what i’m suppose to do. 
 The app is great but, its just won’t tell me what to do?"
I love this app! it’s easy to use and is not complicated. lately i was looking for an app that wasn’t as complicated as videostar bc everything was so confusing but everything is so easy on this app. i love it.
Is a good app to edit on but can CapCut put music when you put a song and when you go on CapCut it just stops 🙁 can you put when you can put music while you edit 🙂
"I love this app, it has about everything you could ever need when editing! However, I have found that cropping an image or video degrades the quality TREMENDOUSLY, don’t get me wrong I love this app, but this is a big issue for me."
I love this app works very well BUT it won’t let me make something because I don’t have enough storage but I already deleted my apps and half my camera roll
I love CapCut since it’s the first GOOD editing app that’s free you don’t have to pay for anything. It’s also really easy to use. I use it mostly to edit yt vids but there’s one thing it needs for edits.. MOTION BLUR! If it had motion blur I would use it all the time.
"I love this app, it’s one of the best editing apps I’ve used. BUT, where did the style button go on my app? It’s nowhere to be found! I seriously saw it yesterday, but not today? What happened?"
This is probably the best editing app I’ve ever used. It has the best transitions for videos and it really helps me and others. I love this app and plz don’t change it to be like the others.
I love capcut I have been using it to make tiktoks or just videos for fun.. It is really easy to use unlike all the other editing apps I have downloaded. Plus it is 100% free which is the best part
This is a really cool app the mic works really well and you can put a bunch of stickers and you can cut out stuff I mean it’s better than any other app I’ve used so good job on this
This app is amazing but I wish we had an area where we could make are own edits without the premade ones! Cause then we would be even greater!
I love this soo much it makes editing so much easier than it ever could be I usually use it to make TikTok videos and that always turn very cute I love this app 💯 recommend this app ❤️
I just got CapCut and it’s already acting up I was trying to make a video I tried to do it slow I so took one screen shot a time I tried to add I photo non of my photos were there my videos but my photos I checked my camera all the photos I took they’re there but if I check in CapCut there not there I don’t know if it’s a bug or something or it’s just me please fix this
It’s perfect but for some reason some of my effects are starting not to work it says that I have to reconnect to my internet because it’s not working idk why is does that
"I love this app 🥺it's so fun and I can make good videos without having to buy a premium or have a stupid water mark throughout the whole vid!!!
There's cool transitions and effects and stickers and sounds 
You NEED to get this app!!!"
"This app is amazing and everything, however for the past 2 months it just tells me I have no internet. I’ve tried everything. Updating, reinstalling, not using it for a while. Nothing works. I have no clue what’s going on but this “glitch” going on does not make me enjoy the app."
The style button is gone and I think it’s a glitch even seen you added the new style.
"I've updated. Easy, fun, useful, but where are those new frames and the turn you into a drawing thing? I've even deleted and gotten the app again and no success. Can you please fix this?-"
I love this app a lot but when I tried to find the new affect y’all added I couldn’t find it. Everyone is asking for it back so can you bring it back?
You guys should definitely add more amazing text to speech voices!! I love this app as well I just think it would be more great if you added more text to speech voices!!
"This app is honestly amazing. All the other apps you have to pay for, but this app has basically everything and for FREE! I love it and it's the main app I use"
This app is great in all but there is a problem. I have seen people make templates by clicking a button on the bottom of their screen and I dont have that? I want to make a template so I don’t know what to do.
I really like this app it’s good and stuff but when I makes a video umm well I can’t get more photos and I don’t really like
"I really like this app, but when I had to update my phone all my apps reseted and my project was gone!! I think we really need accounts because I lost all my hard worked project"
This app is so good omg it literally has sm features that other apps would normally charge a subscription and it’s easy to use
So the thing is great with all the effects and stuff but the thing is that when I have a lot of photos to use on there it just says insufficient storage that’s supposed to be used for my edit idk what’s wrong.
I can’t even download the app when I do it doesn’t even go through I love the app and it’s amazing but when I tried to download it on App Store it wouldn’t work I want to give it 5 stars but I can even download it so I will give a 3 pls fix the app downloading process.
Best editing app ever I have went from being the worst editor on capcut to being a really good one this app has taught me a lot of editing skills that I never knew I could do
"Hi! Uh so this is an awesome app and I’ve improved my editing on this, and I have a little complaint 💀. If I go into camera, I can’t flip the camera to where it’s pointing to me! Please fix this! Thank you 😊"
Love everything about it but you guys should make it where we can use key frames on the effects available
"can you add more editing? add pictures and can you add drawing? it will really help me out with making an gacha intro, thank you if you add editing and drawing it will really help so much :D"
"Cap cut is great! It’s very easy to use, but the only problem is sometimes it get’s glitchy if you add a lot of “animations” or just a lot of clips in general. But I’m updating mine now— so that might also be a reason for it. Besides all of that it’s great!"
It’s a really good app I highly recommend it. But when I transport videos to my gallery the video is slower than the audio or the other way around. But for me that’s it I really like it though 😁
"I only rate this 3 stars because.... THE STORAGE ISSUES. I constantly have to delete apps and videos just to access it, and it sometimes doesn’t even work! Even Picsart is better than this! Ugh! I just wanted to do a simple video! Ofc it’s easy to use and beautiful, BUT THE STORAGE PROBLEMS!"
"Capcut is great and all but, I just deleted capcut to redownload it so the storage is gone. But sadly for some odd reason instead of that it is stuck on loading, meaning that it isn’t downloading yet, it is loading, I have been waiting for 5 minutes, is this a apple bug or?"
"This app is great! I love it but I do have a few critiques, please let us use multiple animations on one clip and pls do better green screens Bc sometimes it’ll glitch and one of my pics will bleed into the other pic :)"
Me out too many times and the loading is fast but sometimes it can glitch and u have to do it again pls fix these it bothers me
My cap cut kept glitching so took it off and when to download it back it did not do it please fix this bug
I had CapCut for a couple of months and got it cause I saw it on tiktok. It has made my editing better than before. It was pretty simple to use and easy. I’m not lying but it’s really good!
Everything is so good but just one think CapCut can you make slow motion so when I do roblox edit I can make it look slow but great so can you do that thank you capcut🥺☺️
Just made a fire anime edit using this and normally editing apps would ask for a subscription but nope everything was free 10/10
This app helps me with tiktok and editing videos I love it some much I never thought I would find a app that is so good but free I will tell my friends and family about this app
"Don’t usually write reviews but this editing app is the best free app I’ve ever used and that’s not an exaggeration. Ultimate freedom, no complaints whatsoever. Love it and 10/10 would recommend."
Okay So This Is A Pretty Awesome App! i love it except sometimes when i am making something it freezes up that is the only problem but it does not happen very often so it is still a great app!
"I rate this app a 9.5/10. It’s good and all but I suggest you to update CapCut so that it wouldn’t lag once we edit to a certain part of the video. It lags like crazy to the point to where it’s impossible but besides that, I really love it!"
"i'd REALLY like to put on an intro animation AND an outro on the same section, but it's either one or the other. also maybe more specific masking? it's hard to mask a specific area using the current shapes"
"This app is amazing and very helpful, but I can’t help but notice that we cannot name our extracted audios, which is a bummer. It would be helpful if I could do so so that I wouldn’t have to look through all of my audios to find the one I’d like to use. Please make that available."
"I was using cap cut then it’s just said u need more storage so I deleted one app and 300 and 83 photos and it still said that then I deleted 1,000 and it still didn’t work"
"It has text to speech, original transitions, cute text options, it’s everything i need. Even effects and fonts, and masks too. I really recommend this app. Bye bye, KineMaster."
"THIS IS THE BEST EDITOR IN THE WHOLE ENTIRE WORLD!
The best thing is that unlike KineMaster it does NOT delete the photos after a month or two. They have amazing effects and transitions, after using it I had no problems at all with CapCut.
THANK YOU SO FREAKING MUCH FOR MAKING THIS APP!!!!!!
From: Evan"
Hi cap cut hopefully you reply I’ve used your app for a while and it’s been the best ! Until recently there is a effect you Added that would improve my skills witch is remove background but I’m not getting it pls reply
"this app is great. Everything is free and easy to use. I only gave it a 4 star because of no keyframes. Maybe there are and I just can’t find them but if there really isn’t any, pls add them. keyframes can make my video edits a lot more on beat."
This app is really great everything for free like it is  my top favorite editing app but can I ask for one thing please it’s just that can you guys please add the cartoon filter on this please.
This app is amazing but for some reason when I use the stock photos/clips when I go to regular photos it won’t show any of my pictures
I loved making edits with this easy to use! No water mark! And many more reasons I started using it as my go to but over time when I would try to use the text or effect it would not let me! :(
So I love this app! Like so much i have only had it for a few days but I love using it but for some reason I’ll get on the app and then it won’t load and it’s making me sad because I can’t use it:(
"Hey this app is so easy to use and I use it a lot for editing and clips I was wondering if you guys can make a blur type transition like “Blur Zoom out, blur Zoom in, or just blur” please I would love that"
"This app is great, it does have a little bit of a learning curve but once you learn how to use it you’ll be editing videos in no time. Shout out to the developers"
Having internet access but still it doesn't load anything.
The app is great in all but when I try to put an transition or sticker it says that I don’t have Internet but clearly I have. It won’t let me load anything or see what transitions I am using. Can you please fix this bug? It’s because I have too much videos in capcut?
I love this app because all the transitions are free you can add many pictures as you want you can add your own sound or choose one of the ones it has there it’s just super amazing😊❤️❤️✨✨
Please do not add in app purchases pls I beg you this app is very powerful and the tools it has are very hard to get for free This is my number one video editing app
"This is the best app i’ve ever used, the only thing thats holding back my editing just a little is that the slo-mo drops the framerate. Thats all."
This app lets you make really nice videos although it can be a little difficult sometimes to figure stuff out but once you figured it out then it is a really nice app
"This app worked perfectly for a while, and then everything stopped working. No matter what I do, it will not connect to the internet, even though my phone is. Because of this, I can hardly do anything. Also, whenever I click on the ""fonts"" section of the text feature, nothing shows up."
I really love capcut! It’s easy to use and has alot of features. But one of my favorite tools called “Styles” has been removed and I’m wondering why? It makes me really sad they removed it I hope they put it back!!
So in my phone I’m trying to download capcut because I offloaded it then it wouldn’t download so I deleted it and reinstalled but but nothing worked
Why did cap cut delete style this is the only thing on this dumb app that makes people edits look good. But know y’all delete why? That was the only thing get y’all popular. Not trying to be mean it’s a very good app just put style back in. Thank and have a great day 😌
I love this app and all but the reason it’s four stars is because you guys removed styles and it’s harder to make edits/videos on there and I don’t see why there’s a reason to remove it?
One day I went in cap cut and I presses make one and it said “to much phone storage” and I deleted SO MANY THINGS and it still said that! Please fix this and make it have no limit PLEASE and it will make the app really better. Please and thank you. ☺️
"Why did you remove the photo stylize option? The big zoom effect has become somewhat of a staple and it’s wild that you’d just delete it without a word. Also, videos have voice effects but solo audios don’t…. Fix that"
First when I downloaded this i put photos and put some transitions on them. And it turned out so good! Thanks to capcut. But it could need more text to speech voice's.
"BEST. APP. EVER. Perfect for beginner editors or even advanced. Tons of options for every feature, really easy to use, and you can edit everything from the sound, to the transition. AND ITS COMPLETELY FREE NO HIDDEN FEES LATER ON!! Thank you so much!!"
Okay so this app is very great! I’ve been using this app about a year and there are some problems… every time I will try to make a video with capcut it won’t allow me to add photos it just tells me to try again. Please fix this!
"works good and is great for beginners. i just started editing and i made a edit with this app that got 20k likes on tiktok :) the only thing i would change is how when i try to watch the edit while im working on it still, its fpm (frames per minute) is bad, but then when i export the video the fpm is good which is weird lol. overall a good app and i would recommend it to anyone who wants to start editing ."
I can’t download the app :’) it might be my device but I’m only saying this to try to see if anyone else is having a problem.
"I REALLY wish that I could RENAME the sounds that I’ve extracted from videos. Instead of playing all the sounds I’ve extracted to see which one I want, I can just pick the one that I want because it has a name."
"I have been very happy with the app and still am but when I make velocities now it makes a certain sound, almost like a record scratching. It’s strange and ruins the quality of my videos.."
"CapCut is a great app! I admire how everything is free but, I do not like how the animations are not the best- everything else like some of the effects, they are really good for edits. That’s all I really have to say! Keep the great work CapCut! <3 ^^"
It is very good app to use for editing but there is this one problem whenever I wanna link my TikTok account I always have lots of problems and it never works so if I want to use a sound I have to manually save a video from TikTok and use that sound instead of using the use favorite sound feature.
I recommend adding more of a smooth slow-down! The slow-down option makes the video laggy and not as smooth so I wish you guys to add that!
"The app is great but it needs one little thing. When I tried to import a photo in, it said, “No internet. Please try again.” even though I had internet. So, can you please fix the bug?"
Hey to I have been seeing people with the velocity button and I looked and I didn’t have it the first time so I updated it wait a few days and I still didn’t have it . So a couple days later it tells me to update it again so I do I wait again and I still don’t have anything how do I get this
Okay I love this app and there is so much good stuff but it’s about when you have TikTok and want to go put TikTok sounds you need to sign in? But what if you are already signed in.I just want you to fix this please I want to put good sounds
I love using this app for editing but I would really appreciate if there was a old age filter. Overall this app is the best I really recommend it to people who need a editing app.
Capcut is great for a editing app but it is SO annoying for when I try doing velocities edit it literally changes the speed I can’t put where I wanted so I’ll probably use another editing app intil you fix this.
I love this app so much and how it is an app for beginners but my one thing I don’t like about it is when I export it and it is super delayed! For example if I time pictures to the beat when I export the video they are very delayed.
"I really really love the new update now they have a very smooth velocity 
No need to pay 
CapCut is a great app for editing 
Because I’m always editing and they just did me a huge favor"
"i love this app and i use it all the time. there’s only one small problem. my photos are enabled and when i try to add a photo to my edit, the photo screen is just grey with nothing on it."
"Great editing app, but there is a small bug that's annoying me. When I try to make an effect longer, the app freezes and I have to rejoin the app to continue editing."
It just need to have the choice to pick or search your own song and sync in the song with your edit like if u are doing a anime edit
"I love capcut, I use it for all of my videos on tiktok. But it's missing motion blur. It would help with my videos by making them easier to watch and they would just look smoother."
"So like it’s good for beginners, I use it because I’m lazy…The storage is really bad! I deleted everything on my phone, and it’s going to tell me to delete more! Can you like fix the problem? Otherwise that, it’s a good editing app! 😎👍🏼"
"Overall the editing app is really good, but can you make it so that you can place infinity overlays? Thats all i want thank you."
Y’all have a good app but the reason y’all are missing a star is bc every time I try to add effects they don’t really want to work no matter what can u guys check on that and also can u guys add velocity if u know what that means bye thanks CapCut 👍🏽💚
"I really like the app no watermarks, saving lost photos, multiple layers etc. but I feel like the storage isn’t very great.. don’t get me wrong but I’ve had to re-download to make more videos.."
I got the app and I clicked make a video pretty normal yeah but The option to allow that in my settings for CapCut won’t show up not matter what I do
"I used to be able to select where I want my effects to be, and when they happen, but now I can’t. When I try, it just goes to the beginning of the video, and it won’t let me do anything other then delete the effect. Can you please look into this? Thanks!"
"I think it should add a update tho, it should have a update to put fire things on you’re overlays, I think it’s a 10/10 for me."
"Honestly a really great app, BUT it would be even better if you guy’s added graphs and maybe some more font options. And if we were able to add more than one animation on a clip the would be perfect"
CapCut it’s really good for editing and I use the fonts and I really love this app thank you for making this app and I’m really grateful we’re having this because I am making my gacha intro
"I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APP, I would choose this over video star any day! It’s fast, easy, and FREE! I love this app so much, this app is literally everything you could ever need to make the best edits ever."
I love it because I can finally. Edit my Gacha club videos now but it would be better if it doesn’t gang up storage quick tho 🥺
i like it it’s a good editor app but the only thing I don’t like is when you can’t watch your edits when you don’t have any room in your storage unit and it’s just kind of annoying but overall it’s good
"I have been using this app for about 2 months and I LOVE this app it is so fun to make roblox edits also
Anyways this is recommended for anyone who likes to make edits like me
This is definitely the BEST editing app that can exist 
Bye!"
"I hate how in other apps you have logos and have to pay premium to do stuff, but here you dont!"
"So this app is pretty good but theres a problom with the words
When I leave the video and come back, the word is stick together and take me few minutes to change it back."
Hello cap cut this app is so amazing ive been using it for a year but i wish u add more animations in the combo section like the after effects and alight motion edits cuz i rlly need that and cap cut will be better tho💗. Thanks for this amazing app
can u add more flames and auras around the character in effects? It would really help me edit my videos! And more animations- but other than that the app is really good!
I love the app but I’m working on an edit that took a long time and it’s saying that I can’t edit it bc it needs an update. But when I press update it doesn’t work no matter how much times I try
"Oml- I love this app so much. The only problem is the velocity aka slow motion. I just want it to be smooth. You know? 
Either way. This app is literally the best! Just need help on velocity/ slow motion."
I really love this app but maybe you should add some graphs. I really want people to try on your app with graphs like video Star is hard for them and us videostar people want to help but don’t know how. So please add some graphs. Thank you- from me
"It’s fine especially because it’s free, so you get what you pay for. It is surprising it has many features that are good, could you some more work though on having it not glitch so much."
"This app is amazing on filers, the editing, and anything that you could think of but this app will not let me have more than 4 videos but I don’t know if that’s my phone or what but if you could plz check that out that would be amazing thank you. 😊"
The app is good it’s 100% AMAZING but the thing is When I started this app it was amazing Now when I try to cut down videos it goes straight down to the begging and I have to use other apps so yes please fix that it’s annoying I cant edit
But there is one problem multiple people can’t get the new 3D style I have all of the other ones except that one please fix.
"Everything is actually free! Even no watermark, and so much cool features in the app! This is a very short review. So, if you haven’t downloaded it yet, I recommend you do. It’s a great video editing app!"
"I just want to mention that we need an “apply to all” button on this app. When cropping, adding transitions, all that type of stuff. Otherwise great app! Please fix!"
CapCut is one of the best apps for editing videos! Photos are cool! But I would recommend it more to video editors ! There’s a lot of effects! And everything is free! So if you want a editing app then this is the best app
"Ok so overall it’s a great app but for the overlay feature, when I try importing a video it says “couldn’t import. Try again” and no matter how many times I try it doesn’t let me."
"This app is a great app! But I have a suggestion, there’s an effect called “pulse bars” maybe try making the bars moving as the sound of the video that will be very helpful!!! Good day"
"I couldn't really find any fire affects and that’s the reason I installed it. 

But it has a whole lotta other great affects and I really like this app!

But I would really really appreciate it if you put in fire affects!"
"Everything is free I like how u can pick any text style, any effects and stuff like that, all ik is that this the best editing it help me a lot with editing and thanks for making this app."
"I love this app! I use it to make videos/edits all the time!
I use an app called KineMaster, and then I put the vid in CapCut and edit it… but I don’t have a lot of apps or photos, and it says every time “insufficient storage” it’s super annoying. Pls fix it…"
"Love the app and it works great, but the dupe button is gone so I can no longer make edits like I use to, and these little black mark keep forming on any white thing like the eyes of characters. While not a huge deal it kinda ruins the quality of my edits."
"I love the app it’s just it always says “ full storage “ when my storage isn’t even full, and I’m always having to delete my edits just to clear up room for this “ full storage “. 😖"
"I love this app to make all my edits. It’s very simple once you understand how to add all the cool transitions and stuff. At first I was a little confused, but soon got the hang of it. I definitely recommend!"
I love CapCut very much. I use it to make all my edits. I love that you added smoothness for the speed but all my coloring is messed up because of the changes to the adjustment section. I was wondering if there is anything I acanthus do to fix that.
Idk if there’s a way for you to fix the lag because I’m trying to make and video and then I can’t because of the glitching and bugs other then that its an amazing app
"I absolutely love CapCut!! It is such a good editing app, but one thing I would do to help is make it so you can pin something and the screen will follow!!💕 that would be super cool and helpful for all these CapCut users!! :)"
This app is amazing! Capcut is rlly good for beginners and it’s rlly easy to use. I have no trouble using it. I would just like to recommend you guys adding a smooth slowmo and hd quality. But overall this app is wonderful. Have a good day/night.
So I got this app and I loved it then it asked me to connect to TikTok so I can use sounds there but here’s the thing every time I go to use them it said no internet but I have full bars and it gets annoying
I use this for all my Gacha edits it’s so good great quality and great for anything and anyone and best part ITS FREE every thing is free also get it NOW or I will come to your house at 3AM and tickle you feet because I’m a sissy Baka😈
But like imagine not likeing CapCut it’s free ads are often literally everyone uses it and loves it you can make amazing edits put overlays n stuff you don’t even have to convers videos to mp3s CapCut does it for you
CapCut is great and all but sometimes I get little glitches in my edits and it’s driving me nuts!! I love to edit and I enjoy when my edit are perfect so I will give this app 4 stars because of the glitches.
"I do love this app but I hate when it says storage full, I have to delete my apps but didn’t work,deleted pictures but didn’t work ether, then I deleted capcut didn’t work I hate when it says storage full, pls do something with the storage full thing cause’s it’s getting people mad and don’t want to download I’m not hating just pls fix the storage full problem"
This editing app is so helpful! It showed me what I can do and it’s very easy unlike other editors in the past. This in general I think I cannot live without this!!
I had capcut for 2 years now and I have bin making many edits for example marvel this helped so much easy free affects and amazing colorings I definitely recommend this app
My review it’s so cool and I can do so much it just makes my day to see cool photos and cool videos there’s so much free stuff and this app is just beyond amazing and well that’s my review of this great app.
"Capcut is so amazing when i cant edit on video star i go to capcut i love the upgrades you made, there is just one thing that you need, can you please add smooth slowmos and better animations But other then that its amazing."
"Bro this is the best editing app ever,
I last use kind master

For this you can:
-remove water mark at end 
-have ton of effects
-most likely don’t have to worry of buying something to unlock stuff
-green,pink,blue,purple screen basicly do all colors

Can’t:
-use some of like text counts
(there’s only one cant)

it confusing at first but at some point you will be editing like speed

Please download this app if ur looking threw the reviews"
"Hello!, I have been using CapCut since 2020 and I’ve discovered many things about it, but I’m having difficulties. The app is great but i was working on a edit and it didn’t let me add another layer and I kept on refreshing CapCut but it kept deleting my work, please fix CapCut!!"
"I gave it a 3 bc it’s fun an all and stuff but it deleted all of my hard working stuff, and I was making an edit for a friend and it deleted the edit and I’m frustrated with that bc it’s going to be her birthday gift, and I almost made an edit for myself but it deleted the files"
"I loveeee this app! It’s so fun and you can do so much with it! Although..sometimes when I go into photos it says no photos, with I hate hate hate! If you could make that stop that would mean a lot! Thank you!"
"I really love this app but, I had to delete most of my edits and photos because it said “Insufficient storage” and sometimes when im done editing a video it gets really lag so I have to get out of capcut and back in."
"I’ve had no prior experience on editing before, I just got this yesterday. I’m really glad I found it, it made editing very simple and easy for me."
I love this app its so easy to use and way less confusing than other apps but maybe you guys should add graphs? I feel like that’d be pleasing to a lot of people :))
The problem is that the remove background is not working
It’s a really good app but I just don’t like the recent update and suchlike. They made the size of the screen even smaller and it’s really frustrating bc it's hard to edit with it and so forth.
Ok I love this app because it helps me with gacha vids but when the update came ( a week ago) it said pls update so I did on my video but it said no internet idk why but yea I had to delete it... but I got it again so yea its it is a good app and that’s all! Bye!😊
The app is amazing. I use it to edit many vids and it’s my favorite app to use. But however idk what happened but the “remove background” feature used to be good but now it’s horrible. Hope you guys can fix it 🖤💯
I used the basic effects a lot and it’s stressful that I cannot reverse the effect. When using the cinema closing I have to got to other apps to try and make it an overlay to make it seem as if it’s opening.
I used to use this app for my editing audios but I can’t anymore cos capcut had to add stickers with cussing which I honestly couldn’t care less abt but now because of the stupid restrictions my m0m put on my phone for no reason I can’t have this app anymore. It would be nice if capcut could remove those cause I really like using the app for editing
"do not get me wrong this app is amazing but the thing is that there isn’t much transitions. What I mean by that is the transitions are very boring, same with the filters. Maybe add more effects with more creativity? There’s no creativity put into it."
"I used to be able to make and save videos but now I can’t even make videos anymore :( it says to go to settings to enable make and save videos but it shows me Siri & search and notification
but overall the app is great when I used to be able to use it
but for some reason I can’t enable it because it doesn’t show
me the button"
Can you guys please add text effects like vita with the subtitles and can you guys also have it where we make an account so if we accidentally deleted CapCut we could still have our saved projects thank you.
I’ve had this app for a while and I really like it but I don’t like the new update. Whenever I try to split the video the app splits it longer and I don’t want it to do that. Also the slowmo is choppy and makes my videos look bad.
I like using CapCut for edits and stuff..it’s a very simple app! I like how the watermark is also optional. My only problem is that I don’t always have the bar at the bottom for templetes- I’ll have to redownload the app if I want the update.
"Ok so i have been using this app for a long time and its great!  its just that I can’t add effects anymore for some reason, its just that when i press the check it wouldn’t let me add the effects for some reason."
so is it just mine lagging or ?? Another day I made a review about lagging on CapCut the lagging stopped for about a day today I was trying to make it early and I couldn’t because of the lagging this is either my 3 or 4th time making a review
Or I have to admit this is a good app to do vid like I do funny ones for my friends but the problem is it takes up so much space and I have to doesn’t and get it back
I love it very much....But one problem when I tried to save my edit that took me 3 days it kicks me out of the app while saving the video I try a lot but it still kicks me out...why does it not let me save my edit?
When I first installed it I was using it And it would lag alot that's my Only Problem it's awsome but I recommend to add more editing Cubes
"But they should let us do are own transitions and more , but I love it! And why it dosen’t let me use overlay and text, why? Like I want to make edits but I can’t Bc it do set let me use text and overlay 
And that’s why I give it a four so yeh but anything else I love it!"
"This is free and amazing. Cause there is a watermark but but at the end of your edit.
To get rid of the watermark you trim the video after saved.l think you should download this."
Is it just me or is it that when you save a photo to your album does it show the picture cause like I can’t see it :(
"So first I just wanna say it’s a really great app! But when I would watch my video it would pause and keep pausing then it wouldn’t let me download stuff to my phone! And yes, my storage is great! So overall...it’s just..idek😒"
"I love this so much more than others, the only problem was you can only add a certain amount of overlays. Otherwise it’s the best editing app"
Anyone else experienced a severe slow down in the app? This is one of my favorites so can someone tell me if any update is coming soon? Thanks! Really really love this app!
This app is literally the best but when I edit I’m trying to find the best so I like if y’all make the sound play while yu move it around it will really help🙃🙏🏽 but so far the best🔥🔥
When I want to do a edit sometimes I put like football players but when I click remove background I dosent just remove the background but I removes half of his hair
This is an amazing app it is really easy to use and amazing at editing as I was a beginner it is easy to use and I request to add the style back please and thank you.
"I overall like the app. It’s easy to use and there’s a lot of transitions. My question is, why did you guys remove auto velocity? It’s no longer there. I used it and I liked it. Please add it back."
So I have one thing to ask…can you plzzzzzzzzz let us use the freaking smooth better quality with reverse to I beg y’all to fix it!!
ok so when i first started i loved it but then i got more advanced and i still love it butttttttt y’all removed style from the thing😑 i used that so many times because i was looking for a certain thing and i would find it there. PLEASE BRING IT BACK AND I DONT WANT IT BACK IN A MONTH I WANT IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
just got it and its already amazing. Very simple to use plus has lots of options to make edits. Also its free which is even better
"I 100% recommend it. It’s so fun and cool and easy to use. You can’t prove me wrong, I’m more of an audio editor than a video editor and all my music turns out amazing. The best part is…. ITS TOTALLY FREE"
"It’s pretty good and the best thing is it’s free!!, I have a request to make your app better!! You can add a auto beat velocity like that would be SOO cool!!"
I happen to be an editor and usually I use video star until I came across capcut and there new updates are a 10/10!!
i really like this app not only you don’t need a subscription but it’s also really easy to use i wanted an app like this right here! overall this app is amazing
I make all my edits and it’s very simple when u get used to it! I think u can do pretty much everything and a lot of it doesn’t cost money!
"This app is the best. You don’t need to pay for anything! It has so many options, and is getting better and better! Recommended!"
The reason why it’s good for beginners is because it’s really to use and has good animations it’s amazing it’s not hard like video Star or stuff like that CapCut Is easier to use.
"I would really like this update, because the sounds are filling up my storage and I can’t delete them. So could you please make a update for this?"
"When we write down a text on either photo or video in Arabic letter, it can’t write from right to left."
So this app is very very nice for beginners that don’t know how to edit and stuff because CapCut is a really easy app for beginners so I really recommend this app for being a beginner
Hello the app is amazing it’s so easy for me to edit my vids plus it’s all free this is a short review so thanks for making it fun I cant stop that’s all I said it would be short♥️
It won’t let me download it and its not because storage I dont understand that has happened
I love CapCut! It’s an awesome app but I do have one problem. When I open photos I have HUNDREDS but it says I have none it very weird and so is writing the end of reviews
Very easy to use let’s you preview the fax and you don’t have to install new audio. There is also no watermarks on the vids so all of it is a W
CapCut is so good in editing anything I would really recommend it if you can’t edit in any app it’s hard at first but then it will be very easy
It’s a pretty good editing app but what’s really annoying is when your trying to click on a tiny picture or photo and it doesn’t let you it’s really annoying and CapCut needs to fix that but otherwise it ok.
"I love the app yes, but it keeps saying my storage is full when I wanna keep editing, I delete and delete things but it still doesn’t work. But other than that the app is great, especially for beginners like me."
Fix the could not import thing or u will spam fake things about you and make you look bad
I hate this app so much I try to open a project so I can save it and when I hit the save button it said clear up storage when I only had that one project so I deleted the app and I downloaded it again and when I click the plus it said clear up more storage when I didn’t even make any projects yet this app is so stupid don’t download it.
say you put a audio of vocals and an audio of the instrumental and go head about a minute. the audios get delayed and even when you go out of the project and back in and go up ahead it still gets delayed. PLEASE fix this
Hello CapCut is a very good app I’ve made a lot of things on it for my animation but now for some reason it won’t let me adjust the speed and I don’t know why it let me before now it won’t
This has surprisingly helped me make my videos lately…. And I’m happy that this app was able to be real and You should download this app.
I love this app I can make so Many videos but when I made a long video it kind of glitches so I suggest you should fix that bug thank you😁
I have to thank the creators of this app I mean everything I need is accessible for video editing and it’s a big convenience to not have to pay for stupid little things. Love this app🔥😁👍 NO LIKE FR FR LIKE PLEASE DONT CHANGE IT😰
It’s a great app if you’re starting anime edits. It really helped me! But today when I was working on Capcut. Capcut deleted everything i worked on. I would really appreciate if someone explained what happened
This app is absolutely amazing! U need to download this app! You can do so many things with text and stuff it’s just so good!
"Good app and has been using it for a while. But the latest version 4.0 no longer provide “reducing noise” feature, which is a disappointment. I’ll try some other video editing apps instead."
I love this app it’s animations ‘ effects and everything expect the fact that the app is very glitchy besides that it’s really good for starters and has a lot of effects I do recommend it
Capcut is an amazing app but while im in the middle of editing it says “no internet connection. Connect to your internet” but I AM CONNECTED TO MY INTERNET. I Don’t know if this is a bug or not but i still love this app
"Overall I love the app and the fact that is free! But I would love if you guys could add more variety when it comes to transitions. Other than that, I love the app so far!"
"It’s very easy and good for starters! The effects are nice aswell. CapCut was a big start for me about editing and how to make it good, now I’m starting to get better. I’m so glad this app was here! I love the effects btw <3"
"It’s great and I love the features but when I put in a screenshot it does not work properly, could you add a feature to make all the screen shots fit the screen without doing it manually?"
"Effects, effects, effects! There are so many effects! It’s easy to use, with lots of features and tools, I highly recommend this app to everyone:)"
So this is a great edit app! But it always says not enough storage an I always rage! So I deleted it and downloaded it back! But the button it says it’s loading liek I cant download it. Not like when the game is almost done downloading. It’s not cool :(
"okay so i was making a charli damelio edit for my tiktok fan page of her and i was making a LONG edit, i finished some of it, turned my phone off and took a break! when i came back i added photos and they were all solid black! then it kicked me out, i have no idea what i did wrong, someone please explain..."
I wish they could make it to where you can slow the effects while the video stays the same speed
I like to use this but it is so annoying when I’m trying to make an edit and I click the picture and it sends me to the filter mode and i am so annoyed I think that it can do better but other then that it’s fine
I use this app all the time for edits I make for tiktoks. It is completely free and the quality is amazing. I use this app to edit my Kpop edits for my followers. I have seen many people use it and love it!
"I make videos and I love using this app! There is no watermark, the effects and transitions are so good, and more! By far the best editing app that I love! You did amazing making this app"
"This is the best app I've used for editing! No watermark, it gives you the option to remove the last watermark, would recommend to any friend."
"this is the BEST app i used for editing videos, hands down. no ads, everythings free, and you can remove the watermark aswell, not to mention how easy it is to edit. im sharing this w my friends defo."
The bling effect stopped working? It keeps saying no internet connection when my internet is working fine. Idk someone please help me. Other then that great app!!
Please never think of adding a watermark or ads or never remove the cool transitions and other cool stuff that makes it so much better! This is really amazing and helpful thanks a lot! 🥺😂
"I was testing out editing apps, and I saw someone use this so I tried it. Thinking it will be hard, it was actually extremely easy lol"
"It’s so simple and easy to use, I’ve never been bothered by ads and the quality is so superb I’m surprised you don’t have to pay a buck or two for it. Very great app"
I use it for my gacha and anime edits but this is great for all of those I need them to get all stars I love it I would definitely recommend for editors!
CapCut is a beginner editing app witch really helps me edit because I’m not that good at editing 😓. But it’s really easy once you learn all the buttons and the new update with the effects are awesome! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Capcut is awesome but one thing I think you could make a account so all you have to do is sign in so if you accidentally delete the app you can keep your edits.
I love CapCut but I havent been using effects or stickers because it says I’m not connected to the internet but I am so the next day tut said the same thing I shut down my iPad then turned it back on then I delete the app again and again but it still says no wifi it works for everything else but that! Please fix this this is so CONFUSING
"It’s a great app I have used it for 2 years for editing but it needs stuff
Velocity
Low quality audio selection
Color flashes"
I’ve been using this app for 2 years and it’s amazing I’ve had no problems with it! I never had the time to rate it but this app is truly amazing!
So um when I got on CapCut it is like Storage is full and I deleted some. and it say let CapCut put the videos in your storage and I go to settings. and it is not there and I am mad but it is really good just try to make some updates please.
"So I would make a couple edits like  5 or 6 and then I wouldn’t be able to make anymore. 3 days later I can use it again. Please fix this. Pls pls pls pls pls pls pls pls
Pretty please fix pretty pretty pretty pretty please"
It’s easy too use and they don’t make you pay too remove the capcut thing at the end and this app is so helpful
Hi so I have been using CapCut for a very long time but the quality of the video was perfectly fine but now the quality is terrible you can’t see a thing please fix this
So I do gotcha life and whenever I will try to get my sounds from TikTok it would either say no Internet connection or you have no favorite to sound and so I would go onto my TikTok and I could clearly see I had a lot of favorite sounds and I kept on saying you have no favorites so I will delete the app and re-download it and it would be the same thing.
I think you should upgrade because when I sign in my tiktok It works for the sounds.. But a day later it says “Disconnection” I refreshed it and it soesnt work
I love this app but like the “ no internet connection please try again later” on the sounds tab for tiktok can be fixed please thank you
"4 stars its good and all but when you rotate stuff it gets smaller and it’s annoying there should be a button to change that,
also add velocity!"
i love capcut so much but y’all need to add graphs and smooth slow mo😪 also my phone doesn’t let me import fonts so i don’t know if that’s my phone’s problem or if it was set that way. Everything else is amazing otherwise!
I tried making something and it didn’t move so I tried again and once it moved it randomly went out of place when I didn’t touch it! Please fix it! (Imma change it to 3 stars instead of 2)
So this app is so good and the update is also good but I only want on thing… Graphs and custom effects and shake animations and more. You can if u want but I want capcut so kinda be like alight motion but without the water mark and free If I can then this would be great😎
This is a good. App it’s easy but hard to find effects so pls look at my title so add a search bar to the effects
I was just editing fine for about 7 months then all of a sudden when I put on a transparent over lay  it’s has a white background!!! I tried deleting and reinstalling witch deletes all my unfinished work in the process but still doesn’t work :(
It’s so easy for me to figure out and I can edit videos and everyone has been asking me how I did it
"Ok so I love this app! But why do you keep removing sounds? I needed one in horror and now it’s gone, and when I was about to reset my key board history because I was playing CAPCUT WAS UNINSTALLED AND MY VIDEOS WERE GONE AND I WORKED HARD ON THOSE!! 😭😭😭😭"
It’s a Really Good app But one problem is It won’t let me Export/Save a 49 min Video It says Connection is lost and My WiFi is working Good right now And it won’t let me use Effects anymore Pls Help me I’m struggling I would love it If you Help me?Have a nice Day Kind regards from me.
"AWSOME but a glitch..
So the glitch is when I try adding effects it doesn’t work..
But!
It does work a lot! I don’t know why it doesn’t sometimes though. Anyways, on to the good stuff!. I think it’s really AWSOME !. So many effects, all free!."
"If your ever looking for a great editing app to help cut, edit, and advance your videos capcut is the app for you. It has amazing filters and overlays you can do and there’s so much to explore. Overall capcut is the top recommendation for an editing app!"
It’s fine but after once in a while it won’t let you do any of them and sometimes you have to delete the app that has over 200 edits on it that happened to me and I lost all these important edits and now it won’t let me edit on it which is really annoying so please reach out and see if you have the same problem!
I have to be honest! This is the best app I used to edit videos but there is a problem with it. It takes to much storage and I have to keep downloading and deleting it.
I want to make videos but it says storage full storage full this app is good but it’s annoying when i can’t make videos
"Honestly I never write reviews but this is the best video editing app out there. All the effects you could ever need AND for free. Please keep up the great work, I will continue to use CapCut ♥"
I usually don’t write these but CapCut is so easy and fun to use! I really recommend it I don’t know what else to say so this is short but yeah I recommend for sure!
So I really like this app because there’s no pro!! Also you can delete the watermark ✋🏻 it also has very popular effects and transitions! It’s a really good app and I suggest!
"I LOVE Capcut, The transitions are amazing and the effects are to! There one thing though, It’s the lagging! THERES SO MUCH LAG!!! Every time I make overlay it pauses for 0.2 seconds and then continues. It gets annoying fast! Please do something about it!"
Hii! I am a young editor and I actually learned how to tween and stuff by myself on this app! I love how everything is free! I started in October last year cause I saw an edit off tiktok and yeah! <3 -had to redownload it tho :(
This is an amazing app for editing and it has NO WATERMARK!!!!!! The only problem I have is that some people have some effects on theirs that I don’t have on mine.  And I was just curious about that.  But otherwise this is a great app!!!!
I love this app it’s great highly recommend! It’s really good for editing and the text feature is awesome. Thank you so much for this app and making it free without a watermark!
"First off I love the app! But it gets so slow that i cant edit the pictures i insert, like when i click on it, it clicks out, and its happening more and more. I would appreciate if this could be fixed,"
This app is amazing I was looking and looking and my friend told me to get this app so amazing it’s has all you need in one place I know I am only 9 but like this is the bets flip in app hence it comes to editing like this 🤍🤍🤍🤍
This app makes it so easy to work with and they have amazing transitions and effects and they are super easy to work with but can we please get some new transitions
"CapCut is honestly such an amazing editing app. No watermarks, great transitions, etc.. I’m so grateful to have stumbled upon such a great app. Everything works beautifully, and I can make such amazing edits, intros, videos, and much more!"
"This is a great app I use it all the time but I just hate how I have to scroll all the way down to get the transition I want, I recommend a search bar for the animation"
I recommend this app for anyone who doesn’t have the money to pay for an editor. This has all the tools you need for a simple video all for free!!
I have been using this since 2020 but please please fix the croping when I try to fix it it doesn't work please fix this
"It is a great app for starters I’ve learned so so much and I used to
Use iMovie it was good but I did not really get good edits and now I know how to do so much I would definitely recommend it!:)"
"I think you guys should add a save feature, like when someone deletes capcut there edits and stuff are still saved so when they re download it they still have the edits"
"It’s a great app that’s most of the stuff you have to know but there’s a annoying glitch where I’m putting a photo in AND It’s says I have no photos! Please fix this so I don’t have to rage, please read this creators of the app :/"
Hey I’m writing this to let you guys know that I tried to confirm access to my photo album but it would not let me confirm it if this issue could get fixed that would be great!
"So, I was watching videos on how to get templates on this app. I look at the different screens/mine and the videos. And I realize I didn’t have the template button. I am on Apple that might be the reason, but I really appreciate some help on how to get that template button. Please help"
I really love it is better than imovies but the audio. When i add audio its silinces then the video ends thdn the audio starts playing 😡 plz fix it
This app is really good for editing but it’s really annoying when it keeps on saying that I have no photos so I have to keep on closing the app so can you please fix that.
"I love CapCut so much! I’ve made so many videos that my parents have laughed at so hard. It is so fun, and easy for beginners in editing! I’m only 10, and I’ve made awesome videos with CapCut. <3"
Hello so I don’t know how to get to the slow mo y’all added and I really need it pls help and can y’all add some more free things like ghost effect I would like to see how it does! Keep up ur app is awesome!
When I use auto caption I have to go to every caption to add the same animation just wish there was a quicker way to do it
"For the past few weeks, when trying to add effects, it won’t add them and the videos are lagging really bad when I play them in the app. I used to never have problems but here lately it is just terrible. What good is a editing app when you can’t add anything? Please fix!"
I had seen my friends making edits with this so I decided to try this and make a AOT edit it’s really easy to use for a beginner or experienced person!
Love this app it’s so great for making videos and edits and it’s 100% free and i’ve been using it for about a month but recently it’s been glitching out like crazy and randomly closing out the app
It’s a great app it is but I don’t like how it always says my storage is full when half of my camera roll is gone an if I try to add old videos it takes a long time or just says sorry can’t add
I clear out my storage and it says I don’t have enough storage even tho I cleared it out it’s making me delete games just to edit but overall the editing is very good in the app but if I have enough storage just let me edit?!
"I cannot tell you how happy I am to finally find a completely free editing app!!! No subscription, no watermark = PERFECT
This is better then every single other editing app imo

😁😁😁😁"
This is a great app! It helped me so much as a beginner editor! You should definitely try it out if you are a beginner because it can be easy to use.
So I just downloaded it like few minutes ago cause my friend told me to get it to make tiktoks and stuff so I did and I have been using it and it’s amazing.
I personally love cap cut it’s free and it’s cute and the translation and I love doing Roblox edits and editing my video on here such amazing keep doing what your doing I think it’s perfect no improvement from me :)
This is one of my favorite editing apps! I’ve used it so much by now. I’ve made many hilarious and cool videos. Thank you for making such a wonderful app!
"There are a bunch of cool effects that I like on here but are a lot of things I don’t like. No matter how long and meticulous I take making an edit, videos come out delayed. And it’s hard to get effect and text sliders lined up. I only use it because it’s free and the most mentioned one I see on tik Tok."
Please fix the glitch when I try to move something it glitches and goes all day way to the other side of the screen
I just got this app yesterday and im surprised that everything is literally free plus great quality. This is definitely one of the best editing apps out there.
I love it and I had so much fun editing but one day my CapCut just reset and all my progress and edits that I work so hard on we’re all gone I got so upset because all my hard work was gone
I use the app and it’s honestly amazing but there is some lag wether it’s turning down the opacity or playing a non laggy video that now has lag. This app would be a 5/5 if there wasn’t any lag
So I swear this app is the best editing app ever but ever since yesterday I couldn’t make an edit or add things to a edit can you please reply to this to awnser my question? 🌸🤩 ty!
It’s not that great and also when I try to do something it won’t let me cause apparently “my storage is too full” even if I delete things it don’t work
I would like to see a option to edit speed of tracks and audio with options between 0.9-1.0 etc for example 0.91 or 0.92
I love capcut for my gacha channel gacha Alana BUT. I really need the music to stop when the video ends plus I need faster transition maybe you already did that since i didn’t update it yet. It’s a great app tho 😃
"Why is nobody talking about this app?!?!?!!?!!?! ITS GREAT😂 I was looking for an editing app for my yt channel that was free and didn’t have a watermark and... I FOUND THIS GOLDMINE😭✋ it is so amazing. If I was being picky lol, i wish there was a voiceover option—BUT. That’s the only thing wrong😂😂 LOVE ITTTT"
I love capcut because it gives me so many options to use to edit and my opinion is that this is a solid 9.5/10 without a doubt!!
"This app is a pretty nice app, but Rn its got a problem, whenever I’m in the app and I watch the video I do, it’s completely on beat but when I take it out of editing and finish it, it’s not on-beat in my camera roll"
"So I love this app and I use it a lot but I have one problem with it, when I try to edit my photos I’ll make something I really like but then it turns it into a video instead of a photo so then I can’t use it for a photo."
it’s a great app! Don’t get me wrong there’s no water mark and a lot of free things for beginners but there’s some things that are annoying. For instance when it says I have to many layers 😐.i hate when that happens but overall great app
"This app is amazing! The best free video editing app there is out there. But I’ve made 3, 20 second edits and it’s taken up 2 GB of space. Please fix this. My device dosent have that much space. And I’ve been forced to delete lots of other things just to make space for this app 😐"
"I love this app! It’s the best editing app I have ever had!!!
It’s free, has no adds, and when I save a video it’s fast and easy! I love it and there is nothing that I think should change."
"I personally just wish you could add photos/videos while you’re editing (unless there is a feature that allows you to do so, but I haven’t found yet), but it’s a great app!"
I love this app I use it multiple times a day but the only reason why I am giving it a four is because beware it can get a little confusing. But I recommend it. It’s just amazing
"I just got this app to make edits for my Tiktok account, and let me tell you, this app is AMAZING! Not only is it completely free, it also has no watermark and is so easy to use. This app make my edits look great I really love it!!"
"I was ganna edit my gacha edit to put on tik tok this took me hours to do it keeps saying my phone is full of stuff I had to take a photo out and also had to take out some apps and also some of my fav edits and windows im so upset
i give this ★★★ stars"
I like it it’s helpful for starters when you get on you are like ??? But then after a few. Days you start to get it why can you add a new music abulm
I love this app! Been using to make edits. But lately some of the features don’t work because it says that I’m not connected to the internet which is not true... hope you fix this
This has literally everything you need in an app for editing so easy and very effective. I just don’t have words to explain how amazing it is!
When I first got this I was like how to I edit in this? Then I saw many videos that can help u edit in capcut and then it was freaking amazing!!
"I recommend cap cut because it is so easy to use and it is 100% the best editing app (to me) there are different filters, overlay, and more! Download cap cut now, to get the best and easiest edit ever!! 💖"
"Okay so first of all, i love how it has bling and no watermark second its so smooth and doesn't lag as much as the other ones third its really easy to use! 😤❤️"
When you tap copy on an audio thing fast multiple times it gets really delayed. Besides that the app is amazing with chroma key and everything
"Well I was using capcut to edit my videos and then a couple days later my capcut stops working when I click on a effect it’s says something about my internet connection, I’ve been changing my internet a lot but I won’t let me see what effect is what!"
I can’t crop how and I want and it’s annoying. You need to come up with a better way to crop. For example have the cropping lines Olin the picture or video you click so it’s easier. I am thoroughly disappointed in this app
CapCut is a good app for beginners and once after a year or two it started to lag and take an hour for my 5 sec projects to download and it just stops working sometimes
"This is the best editing app I have used by far. There are a ton of features to use for editing, and everything is free. I highly recommend this app."
"This has to be the best video editor app on iOS
 Not to mention that it’s all free. All of it, most of the paid ones don’t have the power this one does!"
This is the best video editing app I’ve ever used. It’s user friendly and has a lot of different effects and transitions. I love it. I hope it stays free forever.
OMG! I love this app!!! It’s so good and it’s free!!!!! I’m telling you there is no better app! And it’s high quality! The other apps like InShot are bad quality and big watermarks!!!!!
Now I can finally edit my videos for free and use a voice so I won’t have to make my voice sound like a baby my yt channel is karrie karella sings ur preppy girl!
I luv it I’ve heard so much good things about it the great thing is you don’t have to pay like all the other editor apps it so good and recommend 🌸
So when I’m done recording I go to CapCut then it says edit with accessories and music can you please remove that
"This editing app is SO GOOD, it has amazing features and high quality editing tools
I highly recommend it 
I use it to edit my vids and it turns out AMAZING. If u need a good editing app download this app RIGHT NOW 
I promise u will not regret it
U can add music or add in audio of ur own 
Edit clips or videos and has special affects u can do 

So overall 5 out of 5 stars ⭐️ 
Really good app, amazing high quality and perfect 👌 for editing"
"The app is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese owned company based out of Beijing.  This means the Chinese communist government has access to app and any data they collect. When you give ByteDance access to you photos, videos, and mic, you are also giving their communist government access to all of you photos and videos.  

The app is basically a data collection tool for the Chinese communist government."
I love that this has all the features that any other editing app would have but unlike them it’s free!😁
I can’t play my videos while editing them without insane lag. I can’t edit what I can’t see. PLEASE FIX THIS! I’ve cleared the majority of my drafts and cleared cache and nothing has helped. I’ve been using this app for about a year now and these problems are recent. Otherwise an all around great app to use.
"So CapCut is rlly good but, for some reason when i try to import sounds from tiktok it doesn’t work and says my internet isn’t working but my wifi works fine so i’m not sure what’s happening"
Been on a hunt for a great editor and this is just it. It’s got all the features I have been looking for!!! The best part?? IT’S FREE!!! You can’t go wrong!
A lot of people are mad that you can’t screen record it’s literally on settings my friend showed me the editing app and it’s really good
I love this app but now when I try to use tik tok sounds for my editing it keeps saying I have no internet connection please reconnect when I have a internet so I was wondering how to fix that
"Every choice should have an i icon besides it, so when pressed it will give you instructions or what the choice does.  I am an amateur videographer and explanation on how & what the button does will be immensely helpful"
"This is the most adequate app ever. When I use this app I honestly get lost in the filters and etc. in this app. To be completely honest, I recommend this app to everyone they will have the most best time💅🏽💅🏽💅🏽💅🏽"
I a noob at editing so I looked up some apps to help and we’ll CapCut popped up so now that’s all I’v been doing also what are the numbers under your videos
"I honestly love this app it works so good but the only thing is now all of a sudden after the update my Norton app which protects me from unsafe websites, apps, and etc. is now saying this app is unsafe so sadly I’m not gonna use it anymore 😭😭"
"CapCut is a great app but it has some bugs like I try to import a overlay but it says “couldn’t import, try again later” and it only says that for certain videos I have no idea why."
So I wanted to edit my TikToks and I went to the App Store and I put in editing app for TikTok and I saw Capcut at first I was happy so I download it and it got done loading and then I went on it and I went to edit my things but the thing wouldn’t let me do anything because all the stickers was trash and I wanted the editing app like the other people on Tiktok edit and it just was not amazing
"Hello thanks for taking your time to read this. Honestly this is very glichy. It skips photos and transformations, please fix this. I have deleted this app once, I’m about to give it a 2 try and if I delete this again that means this problem is still going on and on.
So when I try this for the 3rd time please fix this, 
Thanks for you attention."
"I hope to add the ability to write in Arabic, I am an Arab and the content I publish is for Arabs, and not all Arabs are fluent in the English language, so I hope you will consider my suggestion."
This app is great and all but it says to free some storage so I did and it keeped on saying that even though I already freed up storage so if you could fix that I would be appreciat it!
I spent maybe a good hour editing a video then i saved it and I went to go watch the video back and CapCut rearranged all the footage around which is very frustrating. Then I had to go back and edit the video all over again.
I love using it for different edits  but now it says to give it access to albums of saving and editing photos I tried but I don’t know where it is on the options app so I gave up and didn’t use it for like 1 hour
It is a very good app the only  thing is that I cannot put more than one pic in the same pic I know it will sound weird but it is so good the app ❤️🥵
This app is ssooooo easy to use and it used to take me 30 minutes to make videos now it takes me me under 10 minutes. :)
Wondering app has all the animations that pros use in video start and you don’t have to sweet or over think highly recommend
"I love it very much and it’s really easy to use, it’s just its very glitchy for my stickers and I can’t even open some of my projects, I love it but if you can work on the glitches I would be very happy!"
So whenever I tried putting it in slow-mo on the speed it was laggy I tried to make a trend of something but then it was laggy.
"I use CapCut a lot and I know it’s 
not my internet, it always lags if you slow down a overlay video for me. Other than that it’s amazing. But it gets REALLY annoying when it lags."
So I love cap cut it’s really nice and all it has lots of things to edit you vids but the thing is I don’t like that you can only make 15 minute videos or less and cap cat if your seeing this please fix that.
I love how good this app is but for some reason I can’t download anymore projects because “I’m out of memory” Even though I still have 200 gigs left. I don’t know what to do now
Ok CapCut is a good app yeah yeah but when I try to  edit some stuff it says clear storage. I cleaned my storage and it didn’t work still so I restarted my iPad and it didn’t work I keeper deleting photos so I need help
It’s off everytime it goes to my camera roll by a second and it won’t download right even after I updated it :/
"OK LET ME GET THIS STARTED, I love your app so much it helps me a lot. BUT FIRST OF ALL IM NOT GONNA BE ACTING NICE ON THIS REVIEW SO I ALWAYS HAVE TO DELETE MY FRICKING APPS EVERY SINGLE TIME AND IM TRYNA MAKE AN ROBLOX EDIT SND I HAD TO DELETE MY EDITS I MADE ON THERE AND THEN I DELETED MY TIME FREEZE APP JUST FOR CAPCUT SO MAKE AN UPDATE WERE WE DELETE ALL OUR VIDEOS AND WE DONT HAVE TO DELETE ARE PHOTOS AND OUR FRICKING APPS UGH. But I love y’all so much this app brightens up my day luv you capcut❤️💕"
This is a very good editing app! The thing is it keeps saying that my storage if full even tho I have very few photos and when I deleted then it keeps saying that  I cant. Please fix that.
"This app is AMAZING it has all the features that you would need such as voice over,caption,stickers/effects and music. The music kinda scares me, I’m not sure is it’s copyright free or what."
Overall its an incredible app however i wish there was a recently deleted section ;-; there have been times were i accidentally delete project i didnt want to delete
"Love, love, love this app, it’s free with no water mark and I’m able to mask vids for free without having to subscribe or pay, it’s amazing keep up this work y’all, more people will use this😊"
"Is very good but one thing...I had to clean up storage,and I hate it it still says clean up storage and it makes me feel so upset😭😭😭😭 I only have tiktok and Gacha life idk what to delete..):"
"It’s a really good app the features are amazing the edits are on point you can overlay, it’s much easier then video star but the size is to bug so I have to keep deleting it and downloading it anything I or you can do?"
No matter if your tik toker  YouTuber or anything this app makes it easier and makes editing cool even without premium and spending money their is allot of effects! Thanks for reading ! ❤️💜
"I love this app great for small edits and still works great for bigger edits I love the effects they r amazing one think I don’t like is the music, the music u have one ur phone is hard to upload onto the app but so far really fun"
Omg I luv this app but can you guys plz put the icarly font and the victorious font on y’all app thanks♡ and also the bottom features it’s like when I Press on the link don’t work idk if it’s my phone but can you guys plz see is you can do something about it thanks
I don’t know if it’s just the update but I can no longer upload videos to the app. Either saying try again later or video format not supported. Help?
"Honestly, this app is very nice. Sometimes it’s very hard to navigate though. Also, half of my tik tok sounds aren’t downloading and I’ve heard other people say the same but overall, it’s a nice app."
The app is amazing trust me I enjoy it and it’s easy to use but it keeps saying I’m not connected when I’m actually connected please fix it because it kinda ruins the experience I’ve tried everything and I can’t use it.
I’ve been looking for the perfect editing app for so long and I have finally found it! This app has so many affects for free! Best editing app ever
Now there is green glitches when I edit and make velocity’s and it’s very annoying and the smooth slow motion doesn’t work anymore and the video actually becomes more laggy when I add smooth slow motion so please may I ask nicely to fix this bug!
Great app indeed but I'm wondering why my style button is gone now I can't use auto velocity for my edits. Where did it go? And why was it deleted/removed?
"Anybody else chat has gotten bigger on already edited videos? and some words, specifically words with apostrophes are tripled spaced although there’s no space at all. This all started happening when you guys released the update."
Please give back
"So, the app is pretty cool like I mean I watched a lot of yt vids and yk I’m like I wanna edit so like yk I get the app and it’s been going really good. But maybe just probably if u can add audio text to songs, that would help me a lot! Thanks bye!"
"when i got it it was VERY fun to use! and i would keep using it. but whenever i press on it and work for several hours and i take a break, it get rids of my work!"
"Way better then iMovie! More effects! And add whatever you want Text,Text fonts (so cool!),and more you don’t have to buy ANYTHING!!! Okay so there’s ads but I love it!"
The photos don’t show it shows a black screen I’ve been editing for a while now and this never happened so can you please fix this or at least read this CapCut
This app is very amazing for making edits! You can add cool beautiful effects and make all kinds of cool edits! I do recommend this app! I always use it whenever I post an edit on yt! I love this app ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Its a good and helpful app just if your on pc and cant find a editing software/app its stressful it would be really helpful to add it on pc like maybe Microsoft store? I would love that other then that its a very helpful app!
"Good app but I don’t have access to 90% of the effects and new updates even though I update it often, please help me or fix this I don’t have any of the new effects they added."
This app is good I'll give it a 5 star rating but I just noticed ur app is having audio delay and I don't like audio delay so please fix the audio delay
Can you make it so you can like edit the speed for a example: you can like chance the speed of how long you want it to last
Best app I’ve used to edit Tiktok’s however there’s a bug that shows no internet connection when trying to use favorite sounds so I currently can’t use the app.
"Was excited to start using this software to make my animation/gifs instead of my outdated sucky software I had been using, only to find I can’t make GIFs using this app and also can’t even make a very short, looping video (less than 10 seconds) <//3 sad to say I won’t be using this"
"i really really like this app. it’s a great place to start editing, or just to edit on in general! i was amazed that it was completely free because it offers so much. there are some things or animations i wish we could see, like a fish-eye zoom out or a time slicer with color shift - kinda just video star or after effects-like transitions -  but overall i’d definitely recommend this platform! free and super easy and beginner friendly!"
Don’t get me wrong I love CapCut but it’s annoying to do the graphs I added key frames and transitions and it’s still not letting me do it owners of Cap cut please fix it so I don’t have to do this every time I try to do one.
"Every time I use keynotes, they move in their own! Is this supposed to happen? It really annoys me because even when I stop touching it, the keynote picture still moves"
"I’ve been using CapCut for a while, and it is by far the best I’ve seen. It is free, and everything is so simple and easy to do! 10/10, this is great."
"I’ve been using this app and most of my edits would have one problem, bad slow-mos. All I want are smooth slow-mos and maybe a velocity category?"
I love y’all so much likeee😩😩😩y’all literally got everything I need! in one place!!! Like😩😩😩❤️❤️❤️❣️❣️❣️❣️yall perfect the way y’all is for real please don’t change nothing about this app it’s absolutely perfect 😩❤️❣️💯y’all a blessing
"I love this app! Once you get the hang of it there’s amazing things you can do! Though, there’s some things I wish were better though, for example the slowmo is not so good. Also PLEASE ADD GRAPHS"
I love the app so so much but what makes me mad is I jade to delete like almost every app that’s important and when I’m done using cap it I delete it and download the others back :[
I love everything about this app but I do have a recommendation that will definitely satisfy us all! you guys should add a motion blur transition option like video star has.
"Easy to use, but it’s just so laggy. When you export a video it’s fine, but it’s impossible to edit when it lags while doing the actual editing…

Pls fix it"
its an amazing app for beginners once you get the hang of it you can make magic out of it ive moved on from the app but i still use it from time to time :D
I ABSOULUTELY LOVE THIS APP!!  I USE IT SO MUCH AND I LOVE HOW THEY DONT FORCE YOU TO HAVE A WATERMARK OR ANYTHUNG!! i try to ALWAYS remember to give capcut credit (there will be sometimes where i forget) but i just always give capcut credit bc I LOVEEEEEE THIS APP and basically everything’s FREE likeeee YES JUST YES 10/10 would recommend
"I like using this app because it’s easy and free to edit videos. But when I save it, it lowers the quality but still good to make velocity edits and more."
"I’d like if we were able to upload our own fonts, it would help because i just love the text animations and I’d love to see them with newer fonts. Other than that, I love this app!"
"It’s good but it will only let me share to tic tok . Other wise it’s perfect, I just wish could upload it on facebook or Twitter. But as I said other wise an amazing editing app. It’s very simple to use. It has preset music you can use, simple controls, and amazing animations."
I love CapCut a lot it’s a good app but I wish they could make the speed smoother and the blur with more speed and other animations for the texts and new texts styles other than that it’s a great app!
We should be able to crop a certain part of a video  like in alight motion we should be able to mask and green screen a certain part of a video
"I spent two days on an edit and it’s not even letting me save it, I tried clearing up my storage and updating the app but it keeps closing every time I try to save it. Please fix this ASAP."
"Why do I have to pay to get this back, also whenever my ‘ storage ’ is ‘ full ‘ I delete some old photos like a lot of them and it still says it’s full like 😐, I also delete the app because it resets the storage but now I have to pay to get it back 😕. That’s stupid. It was fun while it lasted."
I love this app because I'm a gacha life/gacha club person and I love how the app was made so I can do lots of things I love this app so much but I whish it will add some more music that is popular right now
"Don’t get me wrong I love CapCut and I use it for everything but when I was animating the app didn’t have enough overlay spaces for all of the parts I needed to animate my character. It really disappointed me as I took all morning planning the animation please fix this. Sincerely, Sad Animator"
"When I first saw this I thought it was TRASH. But most things are for free omg I’m so happy! Thank you so much it doesn’t crash and it’s soooo freaking FREEEEEE
the no watermark thing is an awesome touch it makes me feel so free! 😎"
This app is amazing I use it for Roblox and Gacha so it way better cute cute and kinemaster my opinion CapCut is beautiful I got my cousin in to it and she likes it and she edit amazing was this app and she just got it
"CapCut is amazing it has great potential and features, maybe if you can add a little bit more of animation would be great but I rate it a 10/10 a good app maybe the best out there"
"I have used this app for so long and it looks pretty professional! I would like if there were more animations and more transitions. But overall, this app is great!"
"I love this app so much, it has a lot of options and they are all free, no watermark. Most apps make you pay for half of the effects but not this one!"
So this is a amazing app but you can’t search up for your own Music which is sad because I need them song called bad child for my gachas
Y’all should totally adds graphs and motion blur for those who want to really start editing it would be great also add my overlay space would be great!
"I’ve been searching for a free app to make my edits with and I finally found the perfect one, I now use this app to edit all of my videos and I love it so much!😁"
Ok so I loved it but I had to delete it bc it to way to much Storage up and I had to delete all my apps just so I could use it so know I don’t have anyth8ng to do when I’m boarded and I really hate the app now so if you could make this again but with less Storage use then that would be awesome but I really hate how all my apps are gone know just bc of this appp and I hate this
"I’ve had CapCut for awhile and it was pretty good until, I couldn’t press any of the buttons on the bottom of the screen. I deleted the app and reinstalled it and it still didn’t work."
"This app is extremely simple and doesn’t take much effort to make a single edit, which I love. I have nothing more to say I just gonna clarify in my opinion this app is amazing."
this app is amazing i use this for anime edits or to make a amv there is nothing i can complain about with this app and my videos come out looking as i imagined everything is so easy to use and you can also use music from a video in your camera roll only thing might be is... could we get an animation or effect that that moves an image or picture like water in a way
To edit the volume is super hard. It would be nice to type the volume instead
Why the options failed and the message that you are not connected to the Internet
"So.. I like this app a lot but there is one problem.. When your trying to add more photos, some of your photos you have aren't showing and won't show unless you delete some of your photos that are showing. It's stressing me out"
I’m so happy downloaded this app. It’s really great maybe even greater than KineMaster or PowerDirector. There’s no adds and no watermark. That’s all I can say. I hope I don’t sound like a bot😅
This app is amazing I’ve been using imovie for so long until I found this app and it’s way better. They have so many cool affects to add every small detail. It makes my videos look like I’m a pro editor. It’s amazing!!!!!.(And it’s free!)
"This app is amazing. it’s has so many options, all for free. it is one of the best finds ever, and i really love this app! 11/10 could not ask for better."
This app is way better than all the other editing apps out there and it’s completely free which is amazing and it really helped me out!
this app is absolutely amazing ! Period. Perfect transitions & effects with like actually so many filters and straight up everything you need for a music video!
So I like using this for roblox edits but now there is a glitch where the styles icon is gone i really need that fixed or I won’t be able to use velocity anymore.
Usually apps like these make you pay for everything but this is the best thing ever and honestly it is way better then other edit apps
"I'm not a pro but I can already tell that this app is awesome.  I literally tried the transitions from pic to pic and had to go rate the app.  For anyone looking to spice up their shots, this is the app to use."
This app is AMAZING for beginners and you can do a lot with this app it is very easy to learn how to use. This app has helped me a lot I definitely recommend!
"The app is amazing but I wish it would be easier to use at first but other than that it was amazing i love the app so…

Oh yea it gave me a few troubles but it’s okay"
"This app is actually decent for editing. But there used to be a ""Style"" Option with Velocity on it and more. It's gone now, is it just me or everyone else too? I don't have it, Please add it back."
… I’m very angry about CapCut deleting the style button every one I was making amazing edits I want CapCut to bring it back!!! Especially the velocity button it made it very easy for beginners and people that have a hard time with making velocity 😕 I want it BACK!!!!!!!!😭
Ok I really love this but I have one request for developers can ur make templates feature turnable because I have trouble with export button top right corner anyways I hope this gets accepted
The style option doesn’t work. It’s upsetting to see that I only have three options and none of them work. Other than that the editor is fine for basic editing.
"i’ve been using this game for almost a year now and everything is very good so far the issue is just that every time i try to make videos on it and i make like 3 or 2 out of no where, where i hit the video(s) i’ve been working on it says “out of storage” but i only have a bit of videos the amount of videos i have is 5 because of the others i deleted so please tell me how to solve it. thank u"
I love all of the effects and it is so fun to play around with! and there is new updates pretty much every other day!
I spent a couple hours on an edit that I wasn’t finished with and I accidentally clicked off of it now the only option I have is to delete the edit or just keep it there and when I try to tap it it says something about my space being to low honestly so sad this happend it was getting pretty good and I spent so long on it
I really love this app but i have a question for you guys is it ok if you guys change velocity so that when we add it. It syncs in with the beat we are using?
Cap cut is a great app for beginners but it needs more sounds to use I have to switch over to other apps that are paid when I want to use certain sounds
Everyone is posting on tiktok this auto velocity but I don’t have it. I have updated my Snapchat I gone through every single button and I can not find it.
Thank you for making a high quality app that is also FREE I have been editing with CapCut and u are a star! 100% recommend
When i save my video it always has bad quality-
I love this app DEARLY !! I use graphs allot for my videos but recently the graphs have been sorta (??) glitching !! And doing the opposite of what they are supposed to be used for. This is really annoying. Could this be fixed ??
I give it 4 stars I mean it’s easy to use but after you login for musics with tiktok after a day it’ll say “unavailable reconnect to WiFi” even while being connected
"I dabble in editing in my free time on the occasion, and this is by far no contest the best free app that is easy to use with a wide range of options. Thank you developers I love this app!"
"So this app is very confusing at first, I haven’t even completely gotten the hang of it yet! Idk if it’s great for beginners since I am one but it is very fun once you get good at it- my friends and youtubers tell me that. Have a good day/night! <3 🤩"
It’s a really good app but it’s corny and hard to edit at the same time but u really have to know how to edit Bc cc is good u just have to knows how to use
"CapCut is probably one of the absolute best free editors. CapCut is very easy to use, and doesn’t have ads. I have made many awesome videos with CapCut and highly recommend it."
I LOVE the app but can you guys make an update where you add a search bar for the effects because I don’t like spending 4 hrs scrolling for the effects :( .
Hi as a small CapCut editor I recommend that you guys add smooth velocity because that is something that I struggle to do on CapCut also have better quality and more filters that’s we can fade out and more than one animation per Clip or text thank you :)
But I had it no more storage and I deleted a lot of apps and I could’ve only added one video and everything to get about the app but you must have a lot of storage ☺️
I love the app it’s just that sometimes when you have a clip it will start lagging and then when you have text they will disappear out of no where
It keeps telling me that it requires access to album for saving and editing videos
Can y’all add the option to save a custom curve because it’s tiring doing the same thing over and over again
I wish you could search songs and they would have popular songs.
This app is amazing and I’ve been using it for a while. I request if you could make a pitch ranging effect to this app and some other transitions!
It’s a very good app and super easy to use. I use it a lot for my yt channel. But can you update it to the newest emojis?! They don’t even have 🥶jut to name one. PLEASE update ASAP
can you add the effects like pinch and expand in retouch u know effect and make like Opcatiy to color red or black idk that it good idea and make animation/speed on diamond key move
This app is great but It’s messed up all my music I was making the perfect movie and it messed it all up and now I’m sad but it is a great app to start off with :)
"This app is incredible! But whenever I forget to get a video for an audio, I save it, I go back and it doesn’t show the video for audio, fix that please"
"Settings and feature rich and is made by the same company as tiktok, so very useful for social media. I especially like the 3d zoom effect"
"When I got tie app at first I saw a good star rating so I decided to try it, and when I edited my first video I was shook! It was a lot of stickers I used so much that it was too far-
But so far I love the edits the shorts, and everything else!"
It was working for a while but now it’s saying that I don’t have enough space when I have a ton of space left I have literally deleted a lot of videos and pictures and deleted all of my projects but it keeps saying I don’t have enough space
"Ok the app is very good but the thing when I have space it says
“Not enough memory”
But I have space I deleted most of my apps and it still says 
“Not enough memory” so if y’all could change that
It would be very helpful🥱"
"This app is the best editing app by far. And yes this is a real person righting this review. This is an awesome app, it might take a few days to get used to the setting and figure it out."
I been making so many anime/Roblox or more stuff with this awesome app !! I love everything about it I been kinda getting likes and I recommends some people
I love CapCut! It had many different ways to edit clips and photos! I’m not sure what else to say but it’s free and better than pics art in allllllll ways!!!!!
Cap cut is amazing what it needs some changing. I recommend everything is free. Because my mom hates when she has a to buy an app it is amazing I recommend it
ok so i saw some people from the fandom that i’m in use this app so i got it!! IM IN LOVE!! you don’t have to buy anything and there is everything i could want! so thank you for this lovely app!! 💜
I use this app to make edits for tiktok. don’t get me wrong the tools are great but I was having trouble using my phone the other day so I looked and this app took up 10 GBS OF STORAGE! I really like the app and it’s a shame it takes up so much space.
But I really wish that you could also add this for PC because there are not a lot of PC editing apps out there that are free or very easy to use like CapCut so if that is possible that would be great!
So l got in l pressed overlay didn’t let me press it and l was like let re-download it and  other stuff when you press a new project didn’t let me and l know this is shorts but l want to address this to the makers of this please fix it.
"Ok so you may have seen the star rate and I think it is amazing app for like,memes,music videos and,videos it has like better effects and is amazing for me and it is so amazing for talented people and it is so amazing!"
This is the best mobile editing app for my plush videos and stuff no watermark so many effects and filters and ECT all for free? Man this is so worth getting I highly recommend this
I don’t understand why can’t u put the in and out animation together? like fade in fade out Please respond And please change that it would be amazing if u do thanks!
"So capcut is pretty good for beginner editors but they removed the style button which had auto velocity, 3D zoom etc which was pretty annoying. That was one of the best features imo"
It’s great and I love using it but it won’t let me download some effects??(it’s not my connection because I can download some stuff but not others)
I really love this app. Everything is so good and easy to use but I would love it if you guys could put gifs to work from your photo library
This is hands down the best editing app I’ve ever seen! It helps me so much with work! And it’s really easy to use. I would highly recommend this app. ❤️❤️❤️
It’s really good for editing this is how I got into it! But not for velocity that’s the only thing u guys got rid of “style” and now I can’t do anymore velocity but other then that it’s nice!
"- updates do not reset fonts of text 
- no audio delay when playing video
- you can apply animation to multiple text blocks at once (for example, animation apply to all captions)
- auto captions doesn’t crash a video"
So this is a amazing editing app I have been using but I just updated it and lousy a edit I was working on all my hard work lost. :(
Me and my friend love this app so much! and I use this app to make all my videos on my channel so I just want to thank you for this amazing app.
It’s good for the most part. The problem is that  sometimes I can’t can’t add pictures and I have good internet so I know that not the reason. Plus I can’t add sounds sometimes and it just gets on my nerves to be honest
i make gacha life videos and i take a lot of screenshots. the problem im having is that it is very laggy whenever I play it. so i have to keep on exporting the video. which is very very annoying. this really isn’t the app for you if you do gacha videos and you make smooth animations.
"The app is great, but I do believe we should be able to add keyframes to our effects to make our own custom transitions."
"I can’t put an overlay on my edit. It doesn’t work. It goes from 15% to 50% then stops. It is not my phone, it’s new, I got it a month ago. Nothing is loading and I am mad. I have done everything I could."
I just got this app on my new tablet and now it’s saying I have a lot of storage even tho I got 5 pics and like 11 games. I’m a mobile user and would just like to say be careful cause I had to delete the app to fix this..
I love capcut I can make gacha edits and do velocity edits and it has made my life improve and it’s really smooth and doesn’t glitch like others editing apps do
"Since you had added stuff like reverse, velocity, and new effects, I have made millions of good edits that I post. They usually get about 1k views. Thank you CapCut!"
"I love cap cut, don't get me wrong, BUT PLEASE STOP CHANGING THE TEXT SIZE! cap cut keeps changing how big the font is, so when i go to an old edit to rewatch, the text is too small or off the screen!!! plz stop doing this(it's only with the system text btw)"
So far I’ve been enjoying it but I’ve been having a problem with the tiktok sounds which won’t update in capcut when I add new ones to my favorites
"i use this app,for editing and it’s amazing very easy and i highly suggest u download it it’s perfect for kids or teens OR adults honestly just so easy and fun"
Capcut is great-ish at the beginning but it now starts to say that i have no network even when it’s fantastic everything is good though just please fix this
"Okay first of all I’d like to say that I really like this app, I like it so much that I want it to be better, because litterally this app requires so many storage like I barely have photos and apps because of this and IT STILL SAYS I MY STORAGE IS FULL, LIKE I HAVE TO DELETE MY FAVORITE APPS JUST FOR THIS EVEN MY PHOTOS LIKE WHY"
I really love this app but when i want to but a tiktok audio on it throught capcut it says connect to internet and try again and my internet is perfectly fine please help me. 🥲
"This app is great but if you make a video that’s too big of a file it won’t render and it will keep crashing , so no 1080p 60 fps"
"I LOVEEEEE CAPCUT! It’s so simple easy, and best of all it’s free! It takes my editing to another level at no difficulty or cost!
I just wish there was an update patching the glitch where text animations don’t work. Tysm!"
I’ve been trying to change the opacity of the text that I put and it isn’t letting me do it at all. I’ve tried updating it and it still didn’t work. I don’t want to delete the app because I have a bunch of unfinished projects in there. Please fix this as soon as you can so that can keep using this app that I love so much.
"Yesterday when I was on it, it won’t let me put a video or a picture in, it says I have to check my settings but i think it is on and it still won’t let me put the video/picture…"
"Whenever my app updates it reset all the text on my edits to default, please add an option where I can press “add all” on a font to change the font on every text, this goes for animations as well"
So I have used CapCut for about a year now but it has not been working rn but I think I will give is a 4 out of five bc it is very good but I think there is problem with it but overall it is amazing
"This app is really good, and everything’s free. But when i make a capcut edit with the keyframes, the keyframes look pretty bad. I wish there was graphs like alight motion.
If graphs were added, it would be probably the best capcut update"
"I love this app but it won’t let me make a video because it says I don’t have storage to make one but I’ve deleted over 8,000 pictures in my phone and deleted most of my apps and it still won’t work"
"This is an amazing editing app, I can make so many awesome edits with this app. It’s also free with no subscription! It’s amazing app and it’s easy to figure out! It has amazing effects animations and much more!"
I went to capcut to edit an animation i had just made i put the photos in and it keeps glitching like it gets stuck on photos and freezes i keep refreshing it and it wont work i dont know why but otherwhise the app is good
"Ok so I don’t have much games or photos,I clicked the new project button and it said I didn’t have storage so I was like ok let me click the short project thinking it would be different but it said the same thing.."
I hate how there’s so many updates I’m glad there’s new features but once there’s an update the app gets laggy. And it won’t let me access any of the videos I have. this app needs to be fixed
PLEASE add graphs if you use keyframes to make your own transition!! I’ve been using this for 2 years now and it would be super duper helpful because it would make my transitions SO much smoother! (Channel is Vo1kk on yt btw) ☺️
So when I’m done editing I need effects or like why would I even use this if there is NO effects (I make tik tok trends that need affects) and it says I have no internet! It’s very annoying so I may switch to somewhere else where I can do effects!
The app is very good but the reason I gave it a 4 star is because sometimes when I try to add pictures or videos while I have it open it doesn’t let me
"this app is so great! i reccomended it to all of my friends i’m just so impressed! it’s completely free as far as i know, i haven’t gotten any ads, and its so great! even the watermark is at the end and its not huge and obnoxious *cough cough kinemaster* i came here from alight motion but i couldn’t handle it because it was too laggy, but i haven’t experienced any lag with this! its super great, you should try it out"
I love this app but the slomo is like taking pictures and looks so laggy if you could change it to smooth it would be great to capcut editors
So basically I would have to delete apps because it says my phone storage is full but I have a little bit of apps this doesn’t make sense but I really recommend to get this app this app helps you a lot
It keep telling me I have to allow CapCut to download videos so when I go to settings there is nothing for me to allow? So I can’t use CapCut until it’s fixed /:
"i absolutely love this app it makes editing videos easy, it also doesn’t beg you to buy premium every 5 minutes, which I also love."
"Can you add where you can copy and paste key frames?
I have a question, Is it possible to delete a split?"
It keeps saying it’s download but It won’t load onto my Home Screen and it keeps loading
This app is honestly one of my favorites. Some changes I would make though would be storage. I have used 4.3/50GB and it won’t let me into any of my edits. Other than that I like the app :)
"Great features and effects. Recently when I put effects on my video, sometimes the effects doesn’t show on my video."
"The app is pretty good, it's just that whenever I was editing a video and I only had one more photo left, it said that I have too much storage."
I love love love capcut it is free and has everything you need to make awesome videos! It has a water mark clip at the end but is easy to crop out!!! Very satisfied! 100% reccomend!
I love this app but if they had better fonts it would make it a whole lot better!
So yesterday I deleted capcut Bc I it acting strange and now when I’m trying to get it back it’s saying manage payments and I’m rlly confused can someone tell me what to do?
I keep trying to add transitions or anything else like stickers etc. but it keeps saying that I have no internet but my internet is working completely fine and I have deleted it and downloaded it several times in the hopes that it will be fixed but nothing happened please look into the issue fast!!
Capcut is amazing and I’ve been using it for a long time now!! They should at least add ultra shake transitions like video star because those are cool! Other than that Capcut is 5 stars 🤩✨
I always do commentary but I need a app to do it so I choose this one and it’s good because you do not even have to pay for it
"CapCut is a amazing app to edit things with rather it be videos of yourself family or even something digital! If u need to edit I recommend CapCut and IMovie
(iMovie if ur a apple user)"
"I’m a new editor and just want simple edits and I’ve seen people use this app and the translations and clean and smooth but when I downloaded the app it wouldn’t let me do anything it had said my internet was slow
My internet was strong and even if I disconnected my mobile data is also strong so I don’t know why I’m not able to add anything"
I just deleted so many photos from my phone so many apps I barely have ANY I’ve given up so much and capcut won’t let me edit. It’s good when I CAN USE IT! But all this “you can’t make a vidoe” thing is dumb! Stop or I’ll have me and my 11 K followers uninstall capcut and leave bad reviews
"Don’t get me wrong, it’s a really great editing app! But when I try to edit something, there’s always one photo that lags and stays on the screen and I don’t know how to fix it so it’s been bugging me."
CapCut is a AMAZING editing app and super easy to use but recently it won’t let me get into my project it says it may consume cellular data then the app freezes and won’t work anymore can this please be fixed
"So i’ve been using Capcut for a while but since yesterday it wouldn’t let me add effects or add a sound. Idk what to do to fix it, but overall its a good app and it’s so much easier to make an edit :)"
I deleted so much stuff to put in and then All of a sudden all my projects deleted and It didn’t let me see them but overall good app.
This is finally a step up from using iMovie. I have more freedom and accessibility than ever before without paying for anything!
"Just in case y’all think I got payed to say this. I love sucking big fat dicks and love light skin boys, just playing. But anyway this app is really good for having fun and making music videos."
I’ve been trying to find a good editing app but never could until someone recommended me this one!! and i love it ! i use it very daily !
"This app is so good it’s better than inshot, the only reason I switched to this app is because the transitions are FREE!!! F-R-E-E everything is free with top quality. My only request is that you make it more vibrant and not just black and white...."
Why did you take out the velocity edit thing I use tjat all the time and I need it so put it back
"I really like CapCut, but one day when i opened it, all my edits we’re gone! So I couldn’t use it that day but,from that day on my edits we’re staying!😊"
"Used to use this app all the time, but recently it’s been having a huge bug that ruins the entire app. Every time I try to edit a video, the audio is always delayed. It’s horrible."
It’s probably one of my favorite editing apps for beginners. It’s easy for beginners and has free velocity + other effects. I recommend this app if you’re a beginner! :)
"This work of art, got me 17 followers, I love how it just goes to photos and u can like edit any part. And you don’t have to pay."
"I really love this app. I wish they would add a feature to make a account so that way whenever you log in all of your projects can be saved. But  overall, LOVVVEEEE ITTTT!!!!🥳🤩🤩"
CapCut helped me with editing and it has filters  because im not aloud to have Snapchat sadly and it has tons of effects and filters and transitions 💗💗💗
"A very wonderful program, thank you, but it does not support writing in Arabic. Please add the Arabic language in the program as well, not an order"
I just started to use the app and its amazing i edited one video of 2k22 for my tiktok and when i wanted to edit any other video now it tells me to connect to wifi to use a tiktok sound but im already connected to wi fi and i already got a really REALLY good service on my phone so it should work no matter what so please if you read this help me.
"Today when using the app, all of my video clips are just black. There is also no audio. I’ve restarted my phone, deleted and reinstalled the app and tried tons of different videos but I can’t fix the issue. This app worked great yesterday. I use this app weekly and now it no longer works."
I love this app but one think that stinks is that you can’t save it to your camera roll and if I’m wrong about that please tell me bc I would like to save it to my camera roll.
"I was making a video for my channel. I had worked VERY hard on it, and I was trying to delete another edit I made but accidentally deleted the one I spent so much time on. I really wish there was a recovery thing on the app where you can get back the edits you deleted. Unless there is a way, I’m not using this app. Please respond"
"It’s a really good editing app, but if I try to animate anything and then export it, it makes the parts towards the end REALLY choppy. And then it looks weird! Could you fix that possibly?"
This is by far one of the easiest apps to use for editing videos but I wish they added velocity tools for it.
I use to love this app but now I don’t i Download the new TikTok thing we’re you put your TikTok account information in capcut and it will let you use your sounds well every time I get on it it kicks me out or says I don’t have Wi-Fi like today it deleted all my TikTok sounds off my phone.😪
"Before, I used iMovie, what an upgrade this is. It’s so useful and convenient and the animating tools spice everything up. I love how precise the timing is and it’s just… wow."
I like editing with CapCut. It’s nice! But I would like to tween. You see I try to animate body parts but it’s sort of hard since it’s sort of not good tweening. Can you please fix this?
"I generally count myself as a decently experienced editor in programs such as premiere pro, capcut is the mobile version of that. The ui is great, and you can do a lot."
"I love the app but their is one problem is that their is not a lot of songs so maybe let people pick out their songs                                          

                                  Pls"
I’ve been on this app for a while it’s great and everything but I tried chroma key and the this that u pick the color with is like to the side so I can’t get it
"Free, no ads, and not even an in app purchase like a premium mode. It is the best app to use for mobile and has a wide range of effects."
If we could keyframe everything INCLUDING effects that would be greatly appreciated! Small but very helpful change.
So I went in calcite and I just wanted to edit a video and it said “ Requires access to the album” so I went and hit confirm and it’s still not working and I can’t make videos anymore so I don’t know what to do now.
"I love everything about this app and I believe there's room for improvement. Please I just need a MacOS version. Editing on my iPhone is really too busy for me. 
I want you to beat VN video editor.
Thank you"
Capcut is an amazing editing app I do a lot of cool and amazing edits because of the app and I love it it’s just I wish it didn’t bother you so much about your space in your phone but other than that it’s amazing.😁
Deleted all my data when deleted by accident pls bring back my data!!!
"So I lost my data twice, I didn’t do anything. Please fix that I deleted it and tried to redownload but I can’t redownload right now please fix the data lost thing"
So far so good but the only problem I have with it is the video speed it comes out really laggy and not as good as I expected
I think you should have a tutorial on how you can like do things and where to get them to make it more helpful and so it can be understanding more
"It's a great app for the most part, idk if it was just my phone, but it wouldn't let me create a new edit, click on an edit, or download an edit, all bc my ""storage was full"" even tho I cleared out all of my photos, and most of my apps"
It good but if you don’t know the app like me you get mad so I went on yt and saw it not that hard so it very fun so much get it but you get mad cuz you don’t know much
I love the new update effects! I hope y’all can add more. It’s just lags if you do too much editing and you has to copy to a new slot to fix it is a bit frustrating
"So I use CapCut to edit my videos and I have to say, I am very impressed but when I pressed done from trimming the audio I had exported, It went back to it's original length. Please fix this but voe great app."
"Is ok it really easy to use tho!I just wish you can choose music from people it hard to get a good song for my intro but,over all it pretty good and easy to use!"
Ok so the app is really good! Buts there’s a problem if u don’t have enough storage u can’t use the app forcing u to delete some some other apps
I downloaded this app a while back and I’m so pleased with it. I’m not a beginner editor anymore but I still use it. love it would recommend!
It’s the apps on your phone or iPad or what ever u on just look how many apps u have on there if u don’t use any delete some I give it 4 stars. 😀
"This app is great, user-friendly and has no watermark. I use it for text on my video edits. 

I would love more options for animation effects for text, specifically something similar to turbulent displace. 

I also wish we were able to upload our own fonts. It would be more customizable.

I love this app and I love how easy it is to use. I just would love to see these two things in an update sometime in the future."
"The thing that i love about this app, is that you can do almost everything. I wish they added a pitch changer that was separated from the speed, but other than that, it’s a great app."
I think it has something to do with photos and overlays being added
"Best editing app by far!! All of the edits are free and easy to use unlike other editing apps! Theirs also a variety of things to chose from, which I absolutely love!!"
"I love this app, and I really can’t believe it’s free. The editing features are easy to use and they also include pretty darn good auto captions...for FREE! I’m blown away by this app"
This app is really great but when I first got this it said add some Storage even tho my storage was not full not even close to being full but the app is really great
I was making something a little bit long and then when I came back to do some more it didn’t let me
"I love it, i do so much good edits with this please download its much easier that video star cap cut is so easy to use and you look like pro at editing videos or more"
"So most editing apps require you to buy such random transitions,frames,filters, stickers, ect.! This app does not and I love it for many other reasons!"
"I love this app, and I’ve made nice photo edits on it, but you should add a thing where you can put animated photos in it like a gif. Other than that the app is great!"
O love This app no lil stickers with the CAPCUT in front of it it’s easy for free it’s easy to work and I been looking for 4 hours to fine one like this and I did thank u who ever made this app
This app is really good but you should add some settings for the Bling effects so it gives us the option on how much to add or not to have any
Capcut is the best app to use for editing because it has NO watermark and lets you save it with out any paying! I personally really think that it is a good app!
When I got this app i thought the app would have a watermark there is no water mark which  is amazing I would recommend this app.
"i love using this app for like short school project videos, but if you plan on using it to edit, please don’t bc many overlays/transitions/effects take a lot of effort for editors to make/use and the traditional version of editing is to make them on your own!! other than that, this app has a lot of filters, effects, transitions, and tools that make using it really easy!!"
I need y’all to fix or put the style feature back into the app …. It went away after the last update
It’s really amazing since there’s great features and really good quality and its crazy how it doesn’t have a watermark and you don’t need to pay for anything! It’s amazing! 😲🤩
I love this app so much it’s just like funinate but everything is free I use this with a lot of my edits for tiktok I love how it doesn’t make u pay for stuff and doesn’t say “wanna do a free trial” ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
"I love the app but can you please bring back style for the videos, idk why you guys decided to remove it"
"I absolutely love CapCut, it’s amazing, but it’s been really slow lately and I’ve tried everything. I’ve even updated the app. It’s really easy and good for beginners, just slow"
Was working great and then the style option disappeared with the 3d zoom feature. Ended up deleting app. I loved it until that happened.
CapCut has many features to use. This app has easy to use effects and transitions. I’d like to have tracking for overlays.
I used CapCut for almost a year I didnt know how to use it before but then I kept on trying and CapCut helps me for a lot of stuff
"This is the best video editing app ever. I made so many great vids on it. But didn't post them. Over all 10/10 the best for advanced, amateur and rookies! I love this app!!!!"
"I love how basic it is, but great at the same time! I tried Kinemaster before this but it was too hard, also love the new updates!"
Sometimes when I wanna add more photos to my edits it says I don’t have a photos even though I have photos but it’s a good editing app😶
"I love the app, but to cut it short, for me it keeps saying insignificant storage even though I have a bunch left, mind helping me? Please"
"Okay Capcut, I like your app, a little too much. But theres this one thing that always messes me up. How you cant put 2 animations on at once. J would LOVE to be able to put an ‘In’ animation with a ‘Combo’ one. Thank you 😍😍😍😍"
I usually make velocity bases on capcut because it’s easy and quick!Capcut has amazing features and I can’t wait for them to add more:)!
"1. Smoother slo mo like VSCO
2. Add keyframes to the effects to make them faster and the users likings
3. Over the app Is good
If you do this I guarantee more people are going to download this app"
This app is really good and I love it but it takes up way to much space and I don’t even barely have enough space for 3 little apps! And when I try to import photos it says no internet and cannot import!
Can you please delete that stupid blue line thing when you add a image it’s so annoying.
I love the app since there is alot of stuff to do there but the one thing I wish you could add to make an account on capcut were all the creations could be saved
"I LOVE the app, it’s great for beginner editors and advanced!!!! My only suggestion is to make graphing more user friendly, I find it very confusing to do still eheh"
I like making little random text to speech videos to cure my boredom my only problem it’s just that there’s not enough voices therefore I hope you guys add more text to speech voices
"So, the storage you need to make videos is outrageous! I have 6 apps and now 5 pictures."
It’s kind of hard to use but some. People like to use it for the roebucks edit so I think it’s kind of good so I will use it❤️👌💕
I got this first it when I save my videos the videos move around and it miss clicks to much don’t bye at all
So when I try editing it moves the hand where I don’t wanna put it and it keeps moving and I’m struggling. To make a edit bc it keeps moving. Thank you and bye.
"I’m a YouTuber and you know how much I need to edit, but every time I try to add something to the video it’s says “Couldn’t import try again” every time! Please tell me how to handle this! I haven’t posted in 3 weeks because of this problem!!"
"They should add graphs ! It would help with editing and make even better edits , and maybe smooth slow mos?"
This app is a god app but my recommendations is to put a better motion blur so it won’t look laggy my other recommendations is that you guys but some more filters so that the screen won’t look old but this is a really good just missing stuff
This is absolutely amazing!! But I'm feeling there needs to be a smooth slomo I mean Ik we can use other apps for that but like can you put smooth slomo?
This would be the perfect app if it didn’t completely destroy video quality
It’s a great app for editing but it randomly doesn’t let me use my photos! It’s kinda annoying I hope this issue will be fixed.
"I love this app. But I have one tiny problem, the quality. Is it because I have a low quality phone, or is it the app?"
"Before the recent update I loved the app! It was perfect for editing and only had minimal problems with lag. Now, the new update has made the preview so small it’s impossible to make any videos because you cant see what you’re doing. Very disappointed."
God is so good you should download it or I will come at night and I would eat you alive download it it’s very good and it definitely works and everything I do is definitely right OK yeah Twix
"Hi, my name is Jaziah I’m a 10 year old editor and I love this app so much and the people who I make it for loves it to thank you so so so  much to the person who made this"
"Im a beginner and i get tones of likes on tiktok when i used this app, it has the best editing things and everything is free its the best highly recommended"
It’s a nice game in all but always says my storage is full can you please fix that because at this point I’ve deleted almost all my storage
"Has a lot of cool features, and ways to edit videos! I’ve never seen a better app! Keep up the good work!"
"This app is incredible, but i was wondering if you can allow use to import our own fonts, please notice."
This an amazing video editor especially for beginners highly recommend iv always wanted to know how to edit my videos and now I do 👍👍👍
The animation is good but when i do a long edit i have to search for the animation again so please capcut dont let the animation bar restart after i switch to the next photo pleasee
"CapCut is a good editing app it doesn’t have any ads and it’s totally free, i love using CapCut. Although when i try to export the sound it doesn’t work and it glitches, please CapCut can you guys please fix this."
I haven’t found a good editing app that doesn’t have watermark and u don’t need to play I like it also has text to speech
Great app!!! Makes your videos wonderful and have a lot of tools to create the most difficult ideas very easier!!! 👑👑👑
"As a capcut editor, i think this app is amazing! But every time i try to make an edit it says ‘storage is full.’? Like i have almost deleted half of my camera roll justto make an edit and it still doesn’t work"
"This has everything you need
Awesome effects, key frame, and chroma key, NO WATERMARK,
And 100% free!
I’ve been using this app to make meme background and holy cheese it works great! I rlly recommend this app it’s amazing :D"
So I had capcut for a long time now then when I try to export it says “capcut has no memory” I deleted everything it still said that then I downloaded it again and when I press accept it doesn’t want to work I downloaded a second time IT STILL DOSENT WORK I would like for you to fix that bug fix non of any app work!
I think it is overall an amazing app and it has good features and if you payed for it it’d be even better but it’s good as is
"Ok this app is pretty awesome, but there’s one thing that is kinda annoying- I’ll have great storage but then it will say that I have to ""clean some of my storage"" to make an edit or whatever, it’s kinda annoying..."
This is just the best video editing app it’s not hard to edit and it does not take away a lot of your space and the 4K and frames are so good
This is an editing app I love all the effects but for some reason when I try and use bling it doesn’t let me but so far that’s the only problem I’d recommend this app!
I just downloaded CapCut yesterday and I am not disappointed it’s very easy to edit with and no in app purchases keep up the good work!
The transitions are on point and sometimes I get lost in the effects there is just so many to choose from!!
"Okay, listen up this is one of my best editing apps. I recommend this it has no watermark, Lots of effects and filters. To the creator of CapCut: please make more editing softwares like this."
I’ve been using this app for editing and have been running into any problems. It’s amazing. There’s also no ads which is very cool. Thank you xx
"I just downloaded your app, and man a live I love love love it😭❤️❤️❤️ it has everything I was looking for + it’s free.. pleeeeeeease keep it free and make away for us to support your amazing app 😭❤️❤️❤️❤️"
One thing is I don’t know how to add photos when you’ve already downloaded it. It’s really fun to do also. And if you know how to add photos when you already out of the photos when you download it please tell me my TT user: xxtwinkle._.robloxx
Used to be able to trim and the video would still line up but I can’t do it anymore :(((
I really like this app and I noticed that there’s key frames but there isn’t any graphs to make it look smooth so i was wondering if y’all could add graphs one day.
I have use sooo many editing apps all witch were very confusing. This I can use!!
"CapCut is very good, I been making tiktoks edits and skits.. CapCut is the perfect app for editing its all free, I been looking for a editing app then I found cap cut. I got this app recently and it so far so good,   - someone"
So the app is amazing I like it a lot but when I try to create a shortcut it is stuck on the loading screen for it.
It’s a really good app but it’s so annoying that I export a video multiple times and when I look at it it freezes on a part and it keeps doing that even tho when it’s in editing its good and it doesn’t freeze
This app is so amazing for iPhone but can y’all add like more things that is similar to After effects it would be great if y’all did that
When I go on cap cut and try to add a effect it says no internet when I do. I hope you guys fix this also much love <3
This app is really easy to use and it’s really easy to edit too! I think there’s no problem with app!
"the app is good but I’d like more of a variety of transitions if possible. I mainly use video star and use CapCut for looping, effects, and 3D transitions cause I only have the free version. Here are some recommendations for transitions: time slice, split slide, diagonal reveal, etc. I’d also appreciate it if you guys added keyframes!"
Ok I love it but only problem is it use up too much space but everything else is good
"so i was looking around in app store for other edit apps that are better and the fact that i found yours is amazing. i really didn’t belive it at first like i tryed averything to find something’s wrong with this app, other than the delays and stuff this might be the best editing app i have ever seen. but this is a suggestion to add beat detection on your app it will make it 10 times better."
"Unlike other apps, the transitions don’t mess up my audio when I use them
In this one. I have been searching for weeks to find an app with transitions like these. Great product:)"
I was making a edit and it was going good because I’m a beginner but then when I want to reverse it won’t work 😭 can you PLEASE fix your reverse 😭😭😭
CapCut you removed the most important tool. THE STYLE it had everything from velocity to more and you removed?!? SERIOUSLY I was about to make a edit and me searching for the STYLE CATEGORY I look on tiktok to realize ITS GONE. So now I’m gonna struggle trying to make a velocity now.
CapCut is an amazing app if you want perfectly done videos however there is not many effects or filters and also please CapCut add custom masking thank you bye!
"Hello!! I really love this app!! It’s sooo worth it! I love the constant updates 😍‼️ thank you so so much for this nice video editing app!!! Honest, I appreciate the time tooken to make this! 💗 I appreciate you so so much."
I’ve been using CapCut for almost a year for my edits and recently it’s been skipping around and my sounds been messing up when I edit. Hopefully it’s fixed soon. I’d hate to learn how to use a different app
I tried using the velocity thing bet it’s not there and I updated the app twice and reinstalled it and it’s still not showing please fix this.
I love this app so much it’s easy to edit and has so many options thanks for making this app I totally recommend!🦋
So I was looking for the velocity and I went on style and it wasn’t there I really like velocity so I wasn’t really happy so  I think you guys should add it back
This app is great and all but it takes the slo-mo so long to load and when my phone cuts off it starts over which is very annoying and frustrating to deal with this need to update a faster slo-mo thank you
"It has a bunch of cool stuff + Editing stuff And I love this app <3
suggest downloading it if you have not much experience then I suggest downloading this app"
I’ve been doing this for the past like three years and I’ve gotten really good at it and I just think there’s no flaws
It would be so helpful if you could make the speed setting more smoother. I can’t find any other app that you can make a smooth slow mo for free.
I think that you should also be able to search for audios and add Apple Music because that’s what I have besides that it’s amazing
Love this app I can make amazing edits with this app! I’m not gonna make this long but this app has amazing features to edit your videos with!
I love the app CapCut but it hasn’t been working lately so I thought I would uninstall and reinstall the app again but I’m not sure if it will delete all my edits I have will it?
Everything‘s amazing but I think it would be really cool if you would add into the camera musict that would really help.
I have had this app for awhile and it’s not confusing and everything is labeled great. And you can make amazing edits with it
Hi .  Thanks for your good app.  Please add Persian language to the app because many Persian speakers who use your app have trouble adding text to the video due to the lack of app support.  Please add Persian language in the new update.  Thank you 🙏❤️
Me and my cus use this app to edit we love it I give it 5 stars incredibly easy and So much filters and nice songs amazing ^^
"So I made a long video but when I was trying to watch it, it kept on glitching and I tried to fix it but every time I open and close the app it happens all over again."
i love this app and it’s great for editing but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE add smooth slow mo editing would be so much easier and it would take up less of my storage if you added it!! please add smooth slow mo
So I downloaded this because like…it’s amazing. And I can’t open it sometimes but other than that it’s great!
Everything is fine except when u download ur video the audio is always slightly delayed and it gets so annoying.
"When it comes to editing this app is the way to go. It’s so underrated, but when you know how to work things it can be the best app."
"I got this app about a month ago and it’s the best app for editing! Yes, it’s super easy to use but it took up 20% of my storage!!!! I had to delete it and re-install it and all of my beautiful creations were gone."
This app is good and all but it take a lot of storage and I would personally have to delete or buy more storage just to use the app but overall it’s a good app
I am a very young editor to see this I have very well edits and it has no water Mark and everything is free and easy to understand
It’s a very easy editing app to use it’s for like beginners so I suggested that everyone that wants to edit and it’s hard use this app it’s easy and it’s really good!
This has helped me with anime editing so much and thanks to CapCut now I have improved editing with cap cut at least 10x now I can finally move on with alight motion bc of cap cut thx
I love everything about this app I have no problems I love it you can edit beautiful TikTok’s also there’s no watermark
"It was overall great but, it takes up a lot of storage and if I do a 2 minute video, the exporting is just slow"
"I love this app, but it takes up way to much space no hate it’s most likely because the storage I have, and sometimes it would glitch for me I dont know why."
"Capcut is my favorite editing app!it’s incredible!You don’t have to use any watermarks,all the effects are incredibly amazing the flash is my favorite!"
This is so cool! Everything is super cool but the thing is.. when you click a photos for some reason I couldn’t add another photo I wanted. All tho this is super good
This app is literally the best app ever used in my life I love it so much is 100% free like there’s nothing wrong with this app like I could not believe how amazing it is and I am so happy I download it 😁😁❤️❤️❤️
So I have a photo saved and it’s not letting me in any ways overlaying it when I try the photo doesn’t pop up but when I go to my photos it pops up
I love this app but for some reason when I split it makes a chip noise and I don’t know why but still a great app and you should get it
Ive never had such a easier app to use with good effects its definitely a too tier app plus theres no watermarks or anything
I really love this app but can you please make the effects better especially the remove background. It has very bad quality. However the rest is great
Such an underrated app. It’s beyond useful and the fact that everything is free on there is just amazing. I would give it 100 stars If I could
"The effects are not working or loading, the text style aren’t loading. After time I try to used the text effect and effect on my video, it keep saying “No internet connection. Connect to the internet and try again. There’s a lot of bugs in this update."
"There are so many things in one app!!! I usually have to download multiple apps an order to get the edits I need, but on this one it’s all in one! Thanks so much for this amazing app!"
So I recently downloaded this app and OMG its so easy to use! I had trouble understanding other editing apps but this suits my needs. ty for making a great app! <3
This is the editing app that i use and i love it so much especially with the new update just now but pls add more animation especially to the texts..
this app is amazing I’m so glad that i found it the filters and effects are A1 i can’t believe I’m just finding out about this app! ❤️
"Whenever I try to work with multiple videos, it shortens them and merges all the videos into one clip and doesn’t show proper thumbnails in the timeline. It also adds incorrect videos from library. Please fix."
"When I try to import photos for edits, it says try again later and it crashes every five minutes, when I try to export the video it crashes…please fix this"
I’ve been using this app for 3 weeks and I love it but a few days ago the style and 3D buttons are no longer on the toolbar. I deleted the app and reinstalled it and they are still missing. Was this done on purpose or is there a glitch. Thanks
The app is great it has lots of cool things but the thing I need the most for editing is auto velocity idk what happened to it but CapCut if u can can u add ur back plz!!
Recently CapCut has taken the “style” tool away for a “extract audio” tool with is already in the audio section of the app very not cool for the most part it’s a good app easy to use
"Fast, Easy and effective, great for editing videos for social media"
It’s very good just one bug I think should get fixed ASAP when clicking Auto Captions it doesn’t do the whole video just a lil part of it.
After taking my phone into Apple to have it restored this app would not re-download. Once I did get it re-downloaded all my stuff was gone and the templates are no longer there nor is the music how do I get them back?
There is no payment whatsoever in this app! It is easy to use and has a nice UI. Reccomend!
I had this app for 1 yr. I got viral on tiktok from making a edit with CapCut!I recommend this app if u are finding something to edit
"I was doing a template but for some reason it was not loading. All it did was stay on the same number. Fix it, I’m begging you!😞😞😞"
"I love this app, and I like making short Gacha edits. Now, this might only be me, but when I make reallyyyy short clips (shortest you can get), it slurs them into one clip like the first one."
so I make Fortnite edits on cap cut but after I add like five effects that part of the video with the effects are sooo glitchy so I just came here to talk about that thank you for your time.
So i’ve been using capcut for awhile now and when i would zoom in and add graphs it zooms out? its so annoying that i has to use another app. I restalled it and the same this happened. Its super annoying please fix it.
"I love using the capcut for editing my videos, but I'm giving it three stars because it doesn't offer to those in the US region all the styles that some other countries have, as well as the diversity of clip models that is restricted on here."
"Really good app, Recommend using it! It doesn’t have those stupid thing at the corners so it fully shows what they used, Really good."
"Its really goodbut there like a bug that its like gets full or the video 
Goes really fast and it fills up ur photos storage so please fix that bug!"
I love it have have sooo many edits with it! But I have a friend who has a kindle and I was wondering is you can make it available on a kindle..?
I love this app it so good when I make damp edits and I love how you make more effects they are just so pretty and keep up the good work👍🏽💎💎💎you deserve a lot of money
Okay I love CapCut the only thing I want you to fix is the fact that it says”you don’t have storage” I have storage it’s just telling me I don’t have enough for a fricking edit-? You don’t know how much stuff I’m putting in that fix it please!!!!
dude i literally only have like 5 photos and 1 video and barely any apps and it says StoRaGe FUlll blah blah blah IM PRETTY SURE everybody is facing the same issue but y’all are just to lazy to fix it and I’m pretty sure your just ignoring everybody’s CRITICAL COMMENTS like JUST FIX IT I’ve been trying to do stuff with it but IT KEEPS SAYING THE SAME STUFF OVER AND OVER AGAIN if it’s just going to say STORAGE FULL EVERY 5 SECONDS THEN You might as well just NOT USE THE APP
It’s good it’s easy but when you have a little it to much space you are. To do stuff and do stuff but then it started and I waited and waited and it said try again I FLIPING WAITED FOR GOD NOWS HOW LONG JUST FOR IT TO SAY TRY AGAIN but yeah it’s a good at I recommend but have space on your device of 💀 your donezo.
"It’s a good app, I use it but, There should be more stuff added. Like more transitions, key frames, motion blur, Auto-Shake. More! We just want more thats it :). It’s a very good app :)"
It’s actually a really good app but it might be hard at first but it’s actually a really good app so I recommend this for a editing app
I’m having an issue with the stock videos where every video I click on shows the battery charging video
I’m a fast typer. It’s kinda hard to work on something when the app closes every time I try to finish adding the text. 🤨
"The app in general is great, but when I add in audio it keeps saying ‘video format not supported’. Maybe you could try and fix that, thanks!"
Please.
I guess there’s a forcibly because it always says my storage is too full and it’s really not too far I will delete every freaking app for it it was to say it’s 24 but it’s a very good ending app
"I thought this was gonna be one of those apps where you would have to pay for mostly anything, but you don’t it’s pretty cool for its type of app! I’m surprised!"
"I love this app but I have 1 problem with it .
When I was clicking the “Delete” button to delete a part of my project, it kicked me out of the app"
Everytime when I try to edit it always says storage full when I only have two pictures in my photo album’s and then I have to delete apps because of it
"I really love this app. Everyone should get it, it’s really good for editing like a tiktok like roblox edits! But there are somethings that are weird. But overall I’ve been liking it!"
It takes up most of my storage and also it lags a lot when and the quality lowers down so far it’s good
this is truly a masterpiece because of the variety of effects and transitions for a video! thank you so much
Don’t get me wrong I love this app it’s just that it makes me look at my storage and I’ve been doing that for an hour and I still can’t do an edit so plz fix that
This app is amazing graphics are amazing creators are amazing! Now it only takes me like 5 minutes to make something! This app is awesome
"This is the best editing app I have ever used. It’s amazing with so many good transitions and effects!! I recommend the people who do not have it, download it!! 😽💕"
I only had this app for 1 day and I lost it a little I had a lot of clips so I thank you get it because it is so fun and easy to use💜
this app is literally the best editing app i have ever used. i spend so much time editing because the effects are so fun to use. this is literally my dream editing app.
Unlimited Overlays When??? I’m making something that needs more overlays then the limit and I can’t just make 50 projects for it.
"This is by far my favorite editing app. I love everything about this app! You can change and add audios, the pitch, speed, it’s amazing! No watermarks, FREE, I love this app soooo much.😭✋"
This is the only editing app that I use to create my tiktoks! It’s so easy to use and I love the fact that there’s no watemark. Everything is free and it’s great for beginners!
I love your app it’s rare to see a editing app with everything being free I admire you creator your just amazing keep up the good work and have an amazing day!!!!
This is the best app ever! It’s totally free and there’s no glitches or anything wrong with it! I’m so grateful my friend told me about this I’m never gonna stop using this! I TOTALLY RECCOMEND THIS!
This app is very easy to use for editing I can’t believe how easy it is having using it for over a year now and it’s still the best!
"You can remove the watermark, and it has great effects etc, but some are childish and arent used because of it. Doesnt make great videos with those (my opinion.)"
"This is free, no adds. It works really well and you can add text, audio, and effects. It’s the best video editor and I completely recommend using CapCut."
I use this app all the time for edits for my Instagram/Twitter. But recently almost all of the videos on my phone don’t work on the app. I truly do love this app but this bug is really putting me into a predicament on stuff. But if I can get help please help me.
So when I made an cap it  that took two hours but I wanted to post it to TikTok said no there’s no more storage not enough  iCloud storage so then deleted everything in my photos and then there’s nothing left on my Photos and it keeps saying no no iCloud storage so then I was like screaming at capcut and I am so sad I know like I want a CapCut to work
"Okay so im trying to make a video but its not letting me. 

When i try importing an audio it says “format not supported”
 And i dont know what to do. You need to get this fixed right away!"
"Where did the style button go? Thats what i use for most of my edits, please tell me how to put it back, or where you put those features please, till then, lowering the rating. Bring back the style button"
This app I would definitely recommend it helps me with my editing and all the stuff I need like I said definitely recommend this app ✌️PS InSTALl ThE Appppp!!!
1. I thought when the velocity got removed I thought it needed a update but still no velocity 2. It takes so much space on your phone 3. When I have a short clip I cant edit it.
"I’ve had a great experience with this app for the past year or so, but it seems this last update has caused some glitches around the transitions while you’re editing in-app and the video doesn’t run smoothly..."
It won’t let me send the videos to people and and it said they can’t post it(FIX IT)
"Everything about this app is✨
But after the recent update…graph(keyframe) thing zoom out instead of the place is should go
Plz fix that :)"
This app is the best the only thing they need to do is to add motion blur to a video and some other stuff like intros and flipping things and stuff it’s very cool it’s easy to use
This app is very good for editing but it keeps saying it can't connect to the internet whenever I try to add songs from tiktok so if you fix this issue I'll bump up my rating to a 5 star
I love this app so much it’s free and so good let’s you do your own music and everything it’s perfect you should really try it
You should make a collab option where you can allow other editors with CapCut to join the project to help edit :)
I loved this edit game but it used to much of my storage that’s the only problem but it’s still good for editing but any way stay hot and sexy
Whenever I try to use it sometimes I can make a vid but usually I get a message saying storage is full and I clean up my iPad but it still won’t let me plz help :(
"It’s such an amazing app, it’s free no subscription, nothing, I love this app it’s the only editing app I use. I would definitely recommend this app 100%."
So the editing is fire and is very easy to use. But there is one major problem. When I use tiktock sounds it says you have unstable internet connection. Ai can’t use them. But I do have good connection. Pls fix this.
I’m living in iran and because of money issues we can’t buy apps it’s soo expensive here🥺 capcut is free and totally perfect thank you 💖
Sounder fun app but has came with a bug now that I can’t redownload the app cause I have to add my card and I don’t do that please fix and let me know I love using it thank you
It’s turned to video star and I love the update but make more effects love your app by the way
"Its such a easy and understandable app, but it needs more features like better slow no’s and velocity’s, and better ghost effects."
"I think this is the best editing app I have used by far! It is easy to use, fun, and even free! I started using it earlier this week and love it!"
Hey! I like this app and i use it a lot for editing. But the app would be so much better if it had graphs! So please consider making graphs a thing on this app! I’d love it even more.
The best editing app ever used all the other ones are not like this because you can Do a Lotta things
It won’t stop loading and the storages to Little  I like it but can you make the storage more bigger :(
"I love this app. It’s great for editing and easy to use. But whenever I use the text, it glitches out and moves them around. Like on the next video/photo. It really annoys me and I can’t remove it because the panel isn’t there."
Love the app I really do but when you start using the app sometimes in glitches when your trying to see how the video looks
"My internet connection is gone whenever I get on the app
Problem: I can’t use, or even SEE transitions, effects, etc.
Solution: Maybe try to to fix internet problems
It’s okay: I it doesn’t work, it’s most likely because of something else"
It’s the best Make edits just using pictures this is wayyyyy better the video star people on TikTok say capcut is trash capcut is not trash if capcut is trash than you are capcut who ever made capcut should make other video editing apps I love creator
"Super easy to use, super powerful. I just wish there was a premium version that allowed for more overlays."
I LOVE THE but I feel like it needs to add more options to the key frame and we need self made transitions cause sometimes I wanna make transitions my self so yeah .oh there than that the apps amazing
It is really good it is easier to use somethings you can go harder or just simple and it still looks terrific
Hey capcut creators! I just wanted to tell you a question! Can you okease make graphs? I really need it for my edits so we can make our own cool transitions! Thats all so byeee!
Hey guys I love this app! But it would be perfect if you could change the color of an image. Thanks.
"I love ittt
It’s amazing!
The only thing I would like to change is for the chroma key
It’s good, but sometimes it doesn’t work as well
thank you for this app!"
I love capcut but I do think you should add new transitions and animation but otherwise very good job making this app
i edit with after effects and video star and i downloaded capcut to see why everybody has it and when i use to different clips of my roblox character without all the stuff like hair on it and recorded with in the same place but it froze and then rolled the clip really fast so out of all of that i’d say it’s pretty good to use it u just started editing
"I was working on something and I exited out the app to download some music for it and when I opened it back, my whole project I spent about 3 hours making was deleted. I’m so mad right now and I don’t know what happened it was just gone. Please do something about that"
This app is amazing but there’s a glitch for me where I can’t click any of the buttons on the bottom. Before I could but now I can’t. Si maybe try to fix that
It’s not downloading (might just be my phone) but I can’t click on any buttons please help
So I’ve been using this app for  a while now and it’s great but now I can’t add no more audio they won’t pop up and idk why if it’s my iPad or it’s like a glitch but I’m not sure
I love but idk why it doesn’t let me click on effects or filters or anything pls fix this bug
I really like the app it’s like video star but easier I would recommend if video star was too hard
The editing is great. Enjoy the many options. I make videos at 1080 but when I am done editing and I export them and upload them they seem to be low quality.
This app is VERY easy to use..! But it’s also very laggy...which makes me lose a lot of interest in making my videos—can you please fix the lag—?!?!
I love the app bit you should add keyframes for the effects because of the the effects are kinda useless if you cant use keyframes for them
it’s really great app i enjoy doing edit in my free time but unfortunately it doesn’t support arabic language :( i feel sad it will be more great if u add arabic fonts and support the language bc when i write the titles in arabic it’s turnd out to write it backwords :( thanks for everything
"I make videos on an iPad and when I use this, the video is always very very cropped. Other than that, everything is good. It just annoys me because the cropped video looks weird."
"This apps is wonderful it has everything I love it, but It would be awesome if you guys put quality 4K and that stuff, I’m just saying even tho this is the best app in the world"
Whenever I’m finishing up a video or editing it is just stop work an send me back to my home screen and I hate that so much and is annoying. When I’m done with a video is half way finish exporting it glitches out my phone now I can’t listen to music no more all I hear is some audio from a video I made. What the hell
I went to edit a video and looked over to for the “style” option and it’s not there please fix this a soon as possible ?! FIX IT PLEASEEEE WE NEED STYLE BACK
I love the app! I use it for all my edits. Only problem is you guys removed the “style” category. This category had an Auto Velocity many users have the app for including me. Please bring this back
Capcut is very easy to use and I like that easily accessible and when you combine effects it looks amazing…tho I do wish capcut had more warping effects and animations tbh great app tho
OMG AMAZING im looking at other bad reviews and DONT LISTEN TO THEM!!! This app is amazing I’ve been using it for almost a year now I love it so much there’s no ads it’s free and I love it so much ^^
I would really consider getting this at the start it was hard but now it’s ez
Velocity is working amazing! But what would be amazing is if you could change the speed of the auto velocity! ☺️
"I opened cap cut to finish my edit but it froze. Soon I looked at CapCut at the App Store I looked what’s new, usually there would be bugs fixed but they weren’t there, so please fix bugs."
"Ok, let’s just start off, this app is amazing!! But here are some things I saw that I think you should fix.☺️

1• When I Add To Many Overlays, it always says, “ sorry you put on too many overlays, take some off please. Thank you!”

2• Also When I Add Too Much Texts, Then They WARN Me that I can’t add anymore texts!? That’s just unbelievable.

I Think You Could Fix All Of These Problems That I Witnessed. 
Thank You!😊✨✨"
this is so easy to understand i literally got used to it. I used this app for years and i love it. But the graphs is kinda choppy. I suggest make it smooth. All i have to say.
I’ve been using cap cut for a while now and it’s a good app for editing but when ever I make an edit it takes way to long to upload to my device I could wait a hour just for a 3 minute video please fix this issue
10/10 it’s a amazing app it’s helps you edit for beginners and it’s way better than video star cause it’s for free!
So I was on the app the other day and it was working perfectly fine and I decided to get on it today and it deleted all of my progress like all of it and I’m really really upset I hope this problem can get fixed
It is the good app for edit. Here you find more edit option. The edit is mind blowing if you edit with capcut. In one word It's Amazing
CapCut is a very good editing app when I was new to editing it was very easy very free and I suggest you guys use it.  This is the most easiest editing app I’ve ever used!
It’s a great animation app but I stopped using it after awhile and forgot where the good animations are. Please add a button so you can see everything that you put on a clip.
There could be more and stuff but I recommend because it’s easier to use
"so i am obsessed with capcut but i don’t have a certain effect that i would love to use it’s zoom in and i am pretty upset with that 😭, anyways i recommend for any type of editor!!!"
So best app EVER but pls put animations so I can do some clean edits I love this app if you are reading this you should download this cuz is the best app I ever used so far *for editing * so you heard me put some animations and your good!
"I want the slow mo to be way more smoother, and when you do velocity I want it smooth also, so we don’t have to use more hard apps for editing."
It’s a really amazing app but the thing I don’t like is when you cant put too much overlay :( but still amazing
This app is really easy to use and is very good but when you try to watch while editing it is very laggy and sometimes deletes my projects🙁 capcut please fix this
i love this app its easy to use specially for begging its all free easy to understand you get the amazing results you want in under 10 minutes i feel like even if you think you cant edit this is good for you and its very clear no laggy edits or videos you can add effects extract audios and way more!i love it!!
ive been using capcut to edit for a while now and havent had a single issue EXCEPTTT it will not let me animate stickers whatsoever. other than that perfect
So it’s pretty good it’s pretty easy to use! It’s just that I keep having to use the same transitions which it’s annoying since I use it a lot. But overall it’s pretty good!
Okay Capcut is good but why did you put the thing on the text we want it to be see though not with a white box that’s the only bad thing 🙄
i use it everyday i just have on improvement can you add keyframe graphs ? if you do it will be better than good
"I like the transitions, and how they are premade! But some of them don’t have motion blur while others do and that kinda bothers me. So if you could please add motion blur to the transitions and this app needs graphs."
i would not recommend this video editing app. It takes up all of your storage add you have to clear all of your pictures and apps just to make it. At first i thought the app was amazing bit really they don’t even have any good things. i hate this app and definitely do not recommend.
It’s a great app but it needs proper upgrading that would prevent it from hanging or glitching when someone tries to edit. Quite frustrating when thang happens. Please do something.
I was trying to use the style and it wasn’t working I tried so ugh things
"It’s one of the best editing apps in my opinion 
But if they could add so pinch effects and better transitions that would be good"
Don’t get me wrong- it’s great! But when I wanna make a video it sometimes says my storage is full but there’s nothing anywhere nothing in my camera roll nothing!
I have been useing this app for 7 mounts but y’all keep saying my storage is full I only have 2 games and 4 pictures and 0 videos I’m about to delete this app stop!
All right listen I am seven years old and I can barely do this app how do you do it are used a video that could help me I couldn’t even do it said tap on new project but I did that and it did not work I deleted everything in my album still did not work I on a phone phone phone phone phone iPhone somebody help me help me help me help me help me help me
I enjoyed making edits with this except that the video doesn’t load when using something small to make a edit .
"I’m just here to say that this is literally the BEST video editor EVER.I discovered it when it was not that famous, and I was like...Why this app is not famous ?I’m just saying that CapCut is the BEST."
"It has no in app purchases or watermark!! That’s incredible!

It’s easy to use and has a lot of tools that would normally cost money.

I have made a lot of edits using this app 10/10 would recommend if you do edits or tts.

I’m honestly impressed I felt relieved when I finally got an editing app that I can work with.

So to the developers THANK YOU!🥰"
okay but this is great the quality you get here it’s so good and you can make good edits without no watermark pls😭😭 if you’re a beginner editor you for sure need to download this !!’
"For a tic tok’er that makes anime edits this is amazing!!!
You can make slo mo shots great for animation too!!!
It has so many fast transitions I just love it  I would really recemend it to anyone looking for a editing"
"I haven’t even downloaded yet and this looks super easy to use, I’ve seen good edits with it and my face LIT UP when I saw it didint have to purchases, THANK YOU."
"App didn’t even work. I tried to uninstall and reinstall, it says installed but when I try to open the app it crashes, when it does open it’s black and returns me to the home screen. I tried looking for updates and tried restarting my phone multiple times but the app still did not work."
I think it would be a great idea to add warp zone zoom strips as an affect ! Since you can’t do it on most mobile apps.
I love this app I use it to make music videos we just need the glow effects to put on people other than that it’s good
"So i decided to re download capcut and for some reason when I press overlay and other stuff It doesn’t work !!! 

Plssss fix this!!"
"So I was doing stuff on my phone and then I went to CapCut and it DELETED EVERYTHING and ALL MY PROGRESS everything else was fine but everything was deleted so I deleted the app and redownloaded it again, but I lost EVERYTHING."
"If you make edits of your idols like BTS,Ariana Grande, Billie Eilish and other people..this app is perfect because its easy to use and you can learn more from editing"
My hard work got deleted when i accidentally logged out of my edit! omggg i thought you guys would auto saved what happened
But I deleted almost all my pictures to have the thing work and it’s still not working for me so anyone have tips?
"I love the app, but the Style option comes and goes.  I have no clue why.  Sometimes it’s there, sometimes it’s not.   I live in the US.  Is there a fix for this?"
Every time when I try to edit my Gacha life on. There capcut make some of my screen shots black and it’s annoying😤😠 I been using capcut for 2 years now and that’s never happen AND PLEASE MAKE A LESS LAGGY OMG- I’m so close to deleting this app
"So I have been using CapCut for a while 
But for some reason the style button is gone on mine and I can’t use the auto velocity anymore"
O had cap cut for like 5 months and i never was able to understand anything and it made me get a lot of hate of my edited videos saying they were “childish”  and “poorly made”  i really hope it becomes more easier 🙁
I think this app is good I like to edit things on this app this is one of my favorite apps if you don’t have it then get it now!!!☺️☺️☺️
Why Is it saying my storage is full when clearly I just download 20 games and screen recorded 50 things this app is just Broken
I’m not writing a paragraph cause all I need to say is that it’s the best editing app and it’s awesome that’s why I gave it 5 stars but I wish I could do a billion stars
This app is great it helps me make little videos to show my friend and it helps my sister make videos
Ok so like it said i had to much storage in my photos so I deleted all and it’s still says full storage and so I deleted the storage and it’s still say FULL STORAGE I’m so confused and mad
(I am a beginner) CapCut is easy to use but I can’t get CapCut to update my new tiktok sounds so that I can use them for videos
I keep getting kicked out of the app when i try to edit the video affects! Why and can you fix it please its getting annoying..-
"Really good app but can you fix the lag please. When i insert 0.1 second photos, it doesnt play or load, it pauses and glitches the app. I love this app but please fix this."
"Hey so basically I downloaded capcut and it’s just taking too long to finish downloading it’s already three hours literally me and my friend is waiting on and and my wifi is perfectly fine too like omg !!, BTW* love the fonts😁"
You get access to so many beginner friendly editing tools and it’s all free please stay this way I beg
This is a great app but I keep seeing the same stuff and it’s kinda annoying. It’s a great app but if your looking for something more advanced this is not the app for you.
"10/10 app would 100% recommend, i do a lot of edits on this and they all come out exactly how i want"
I accidentally click some thing for the age and know I gotta wait 24 hours
I’ve been using it for almost a year now I love all of the features and it made my YT channel be better this app is great I really recommend it
Is the best app!!! But the problem is it takes up a lot of storage!!but is great for making my videos!!!
Just downloaded the app and my video never import I literally had to reinstall the app twice and still barely got all my videos to import. I’m not sure what else I need to do to improve this issue but it’s very frustrating when it comes to the daily content I’m trying to make.
I really love using this app but for some reason my text boxes keep disappearing and or moving to another slide even thought it says it there but it’s not.
I used to use kinemaster for my video editing. I heard about CapCut and wanted to try it out. IT WAS ALREADY SO MUCH BETTER. I will be using this app for my video editing now.
"Beauty effects are glitched. Every time I try to apply them, it seems fine, but once I export the video, it looks noticeably pixelated. Ran into this problem over a month ago. Hoped they’d fixed it by now."
Capcut is great it just need some features like graphs but besides that it’s a great app the app was my first editing choice but i spend too much storage but it’s great for beginners who don’t know what or how to edit
"I like the app but it takes up too much storage. I’ve deleted so many of my favorite apps, games and photos and it still says not enough storage."
"WHY ARE YOU READING THIS, JUST GET IT ALREADY (the only suggestion I have is if it had the music where you could just search a song up on the app and add it to ur vid)"
It’s amazing but it takes up a lot of storage so I recommend having a lot of storage If you get it
"Add an option for us to upload our own fonts instead of using the BORING ones that are one there. 
THATS MY ONLY POINTER
#letusaddourownfonts 🙈🥰🤣🥺💋"
"I use this for anime editing (my insta is skorvvy if you wanna check out some edits) and I love it, it’s soo easy. There are some thing you have to learn but after that it’s easy, quick, and awesome"
I love this app I use it for all of my edits it’s wonderful but there are two issues. There are no graphics in this app my moving edits don’t look good and the keyframe glitches sometimes I love this but it needs graphics.
"So, I love this app and it’s great but,I saw that you can make your own transitions so I tired a zoom in but it’s not smooth so could you guys add graphs like how Funimate and after effects have? Thanks overall this app is great!"
"Honestly i am very much happy with this app, but being happy doesn’t mean being ultimately happy for me this app lacks some features like 
1. Background noise cancellation (background noise in voiceover makes voiceover dusty)
2. Language problem (This is particularly for Nepal, we cannot add our own language, so it would be great if we could write in our own native language)

I hope the coming update responds to this matter as well. 
Thank you
Love from Nepal🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵"
"It would be a lot easier to Make videos with out having to delete app,photos . and Having to stress"
"Easy to learn how to use, no ads, no in-app purchases and no logo on the videos you create. The perfect app for editing videos!"
"I wouldn’t change a thing and believe me, I’ve used lots of these apps. Thank you!"
"Okay so are you looking for a video edit app for beginners?Well get CapCut it work sOoOo good!And you can also share your edits to apps like TikTok,Instagram, Facebook and others apps so get CapCut RN ✋👏😎"
"Hello capcut I was very new to this app I always saw people use it for videos I thought it would be hard.

It wasn’t at all I just needed help with the overlays I learned that sooner and yeah it was a great app.

My favorite part was when you have the velocity it help really well for my video edits, it moves nice and slow I like to create mines for voices tho.

Ty for this app capcut have a wonderful day."
Whenever I try to edit my capcut lags and I can’t get the beats right because of it is there  a fix to this or can anyone help me?
Can you guys please make another effect similar to Club Mood in the party catalog but without the annoying blue filter??
"Actually a good free app, there’s no watermark and the edits are really good, coming from someone who uses this app to edit daily, I strongly recommend it"
So basically it’s saying “couldn’t import” i’ve been trying. over an hour but the app is really good sometimes it crashes so fix that.
"Dear Capcut,

  I could not explain how much I love this app, I had saw some gacha tubers using it and I decided to get it too. And I definitely don’t regret it! There are so many options and so much variety! I can’t believe I never used this before! I hope you get even more good reviews like mine and wis you hope and success. 

(PS: I would’ve gave you 10 stars)

-Unkown User"
I give this a 100% but the only problem it’s really slow
It’s so easy to edit here and the features are amazing. No I’m not a bot I’m a real person. It’s so easy to understand you guys should try it!
I like CapCut the only thing I don’t like is when it says “storage full” and when I empty my storage it will keep say storage full. WHEN I LITERALLY DELETED EVERYTHING FROM MY PHONE anyways I would of loved it if wasn’t saying storage full
"I your looking for the most easiest and free editing app experience, use capcut! It’s so easy to understand to:) I totally recommend for new editors."
It’s meh I hate it when it says I no storage then I delete everything and still says it and we need accounts I hate when I delete the app and all my edits I have done and work is gone is annoying
"i love all the different ways you can use effects, sound, and PNGs. this app is so much fun and lets me explore my creativity! thank you, capcut :3"
"I LOVE THIS APP!But they need to add more translations because I have been having it for a long time and there is never new ones, I think that they could add some like ae or vs ones!"
I love how I can edit my tiktok videos on movie reviews more easier and only takes about 40 mins to do so 5/5
"This app is fantastic! Although it does miss a couple of feature that would be nice to have, such as importable fonts."
"This app is so fun to use! The only thing that really bothers me is that you can’t align the text in anyway way except center. That’s INFURIATING. Other than that, I’d highly recommend this app!"
"Y’all need to get this app. The effects are amazing! The stickers are really cool. I am in-love with the transitions, a warning for people who have seizures there is flashing effects"
I give this app a 4 star rating I would give it a 5 but it would be awesome if you could use your own fonts like system fonts section pleaseeee that would be so niceee
"I love this app very much, a lot of editing apps have like a watermark but CapCut doesn’t, and that’s very nice. Everything is free! Thank you for exciting people who made CapCut ♡♡♡"
I have used it for videos and it went viral  if there was 10 starts I would give this app a ten
Hi guys love the app it’s great for editing however there’s something missing it’s the smooth rotate animation if you guys can add that I’m pretty sure everyone will love it
"I really love this app, everything’s free and there’s no watermark but I would really like it if we could make or edit transitions because I would want to make some for my own edits!"
It’s great but at some part it will stop and also can you add more features like more things that move the video
This app is the best editing app out there is absolutely amazing for your edits and I highly recommend it it is awesome!
"When trying to put in screen shots the app glitches and skips some of it ,pls fix!"
Wow i love this app! Sometimes i delete it because i wanna download different things but im gonna keep it now:) I hope i dont get full storage:D
"Its good- but when i saw i couldn't do they style/velocity— i tried to update it. but when i updated it, it still wasnt there? what happened? please add it back!"
"I would give this a 4.5, but I sadly can’t. “CapCut isn’t an editing app” they say, of course it’s not until you start exploring more of it. It’s actually a pretty good editing app."
"I can’t reverse my video and I don’t know why, CapCut I need this and I thought I was going to have a smooth editing process please fix this! And stop removing the best options like velocity etc. stop doing that 🤦🏾‍♂️"
Why did u remove the remove background feature 😭😭😭
Please see this this cap cut is good and all but sometimes it can take up my space and I would have to re-download it so my space can like not say you have lots of pics BUT I DONT I mean otherwise then that it’s pretty good
I don’t have the new text animations but the rest are amazingly
So I’m a yt creator but just you know not that good so like I need help with the new update because everyone got it but I haven’t
It’s great if it didn’t take 60 years to work. It will not let me crop by making the screen go black then when I clear the tab and go back in the app just doesn’t load or stays a black screen
So I try like every editor apps but never understand so I saw capcut then I realized that I understand and that’s why it’s a very good app.
"I love the ability to use all of the effects and editing tools form TikTok, but when I try to use TikTok sounds it keeps saying I am not connected to the internet (although I clearly am - that’s how I’m submitting this review). With the sounds, it loses most of its appeal."
I really like it :) I just wish that it lets you change the pitch of extracted audio.
"Why is it necessary that this app has to follow you what you are doing in the internet. I don’t know🤷
Why do they need to see all my contacts? I don’t know. It has nothing to do with the working of the app so stop now doing this.
I think we sit using this app before the privacy and following acts are gone."
A really great app has lots of helpful tools for edits I would recommend it to every single small editor!
When I first got this app is was working SO GOOD but then throughout the years it started glitching asking me weird stuff. It also kept taking away my edits and making me delete my best ones😤👎. This game is not good the updates aren’t even helpful.
Whenever I try to make something shorter it doesn’t work it just glitches out and I can’t post it so you should fix that. Over all the app is ok just make it better.
"You added the graphs thing, I clicked and read what it does but I’m confused on how to use it."
It’s amazing I like to make videos and show my family I can edit so many things I can bet who made this is rich
This is better than paid editors on pc this is easy to use and it has very cool effects
"CapCut is a great editing app for starters. Not as harder as after effects and video star, what I don’t like is that CapCut doesn’t have what I need and a suggestion! Could you add more animations?"
I don’t really like the update I can’t log into my account and get my drafts back I’m having a hard time doing that so if someone can please help me.
CapCut is absolutely amazing. I use it for my gacha videos. 10/10 highly recommend! 😉😊
"When I get the app and make and edit I have to re-get the app, now I can’t get it. Plus it says I have to much storage."
I love CapCut but there is problems with it there is lag and takes up a lot of my storage and my edits are having a error and I’m scared if I have to delete them my only complaints are lag and error loading edits and my storage.
"I downloaded the app,then my storage was full so l deleted the app and it’s taking forever to download please help"
"Ok, I’ve been using CapCut for EVERYTHING for months now and it’s simple to use but the problem is, all of my edits are blurry or kinda out of time:/ CapCut is great but the quality... just no"
I use this app every time I make a Kpop edit I always use this app and I like it also I’m not good with writing reviews
"This app is a great app for simple editing but it uses so much storage for example 2 days after using it, it is taking 9.5 GB of storage"
This is a AMAZING APP just the storage it takes up so much storage I had to force my parents to buy me more storage
Ok so I use this app to edit all my TikTok videos AND IT IS AMAZING although sometimes when I try to put a text it doesn’t go through but this app gets a 5 star <3
It’s an amazing app I use it to make roblox videos even though it has some complications it’s just amazing and good
"I never write reviews, but for this app, I had to! It’s 100% free, so if u are someone cheap like me, you will love this app!!"
"Okay, I love this app. 100% recommend it. The transitions are amazing, and I love how you can add music from your camera roll! I love the filters too this is the bestest app ever!"
"I really like to use capcut but the thing is I cant use 2 effects or more at the sametimws, so I have to export and use the other effect again. Pls update it!"
"This app is one of my favorite apps, I edit my tiktoks and if you get more into this app or learn more u can do amazing edits and it doesn’t have a watermark"
Is it possible to add a shake affect just a plain simple one that just shakes the screen?
It has so many editing tools and is very easy to use. One thing is I wish I could have it on my pc
"It’s simply AMAZING! All the cool features are for free, and it’s very easy to use for beginners! I highly suggest downloading it. It’s very useful and fun, not to mention very easy to use!"
This has all the features I need to edit short videos! Not to mention there’s no watermark! Love it!
The app is amazing but it always says I have no space. I deleted a lot of apps just to edit something. It still says I have no space.
it gets so annoying when I’m trying to edit a video and the app always says “insufficient storage” why does this app need so much storage??? it literally drains my phone of storage. it’s annoying. please fix.
Ok so I downloaded this app because well I was looking for a new app. So I downloaded it and now I edit daily on this thing! Tysm for making this!
"So I’ve gotten into make edits, I’m so happy I found CapCut. Though it isn’t updating, I don’t know if it takes a minute. Very good if your into making gacha edits! Would recommend!"
I really love this app it’s pretty awsome but right now I’m trying to import about 6 videos and make a transition but it’s letting me even import 1!
"Okay so I was using kinemaster, but there were not many trans. But when I found CapCut IT CHANGED MY LIFE! It’s the best app, it’s lag free💖 all the trans are free, and it’s an amazing app to use! You can legit edit like a pro😌💅🏽"
Can y’all please put a new function on the app cuz I have a problem with my phone that doesn’t let press some things and I try to click overly but it doesn’t let me :( can Y’all fix it or just do a rotate phone function plz
I love this app so much I use it for litterly everything and it has no watermark which makes it even better but can u add some more effects??🤍
This is so good I love is so much but there is a problem. The app glitches a lot so if you could fix it pls it would make my day
I’m sorry but I’ve been deleting things and deleting things and everytime I get back on the app it always has to say for me to clean up more storage when I done erased over 3000 photos and videos and deleted multiple apps!! Don’t get me wrong this is a cool app and good to make edits on! But it just isn’t quiet good whenever I try! Have a nice day.✨
"So I’ve been using CapCut to edit photos and it is amazing. There is a flaw however. When adjusting the time limit for photos, you should be allowed to set the duration for all photos, not just one at a time."
I use lots of editing apps but this is the best one in my opinion. Developers please keep doing what your doing I love this app my favorite.
I love this app! It’s so easy to use and I love it very much! You definitely get this app it’s awesome for edits! I made stuff that I thought I could never do!
This is app is so easy and fun to edit on. There are all sorts of animations and transitions and extra effects. The only thing I would suggest to add more animations :)
I honestly love how you don’t have to pay for anything to make a good edit. It doesn’t even have a watermark!
"Auto velocity is gone from my app for some reason. When I need to make a edit but don’t have the energy to actually take all the time, THIS makes me MAD. Why is it gone? Fix it."
"THE SLOWMO STYLE THING IS GONE!!! 
And that’s the only thing that actually made it fun to use CapCut. 
Is it not available in iPhone no more? My friends Samsung still has it."
I am not the biggest editor and this app makes thing easier I just wish I could use it on my computer
I just use this for editing music and it really helps a lot thanks!
Every time I try to do smooth slow motion a random green frame pops up and ruins the whole edit please fix this issue<33
I see so many people having fun with the app with the that new update but I can’t find it like where is it😡😡😡😡 The apps fine but I just can’t find the new thing in the app😡😡😡
"FReEeEeEeEEeEeEEEE!!!!!! It’s free, what else could you want, well I mean you could want more funny video effects and a better font (meme font for example) but overall free and useful."
Would highly recommend for beginners or just anyone:3
This is a good app but sometimes when I try to do the velocity it goes slow very slow please fix that.
I like the app but when I write in different language the words don’t come out right like Arabic they come out separated. can you please fixe it ?
I have made many things for my family and myself that are just so amazing and all because if this app
Rhdhdhrhdhfh
It’s a great app but one thing I wish they had were a place where you can add font size so my words can be more accurate with their sizes.
CapCut is not letting me put any audio. It’s just telling me that I don’t have any connection whatsoever? Overall this app is amazing and I hope this keeps going!
this is horrible i try to make an edit and when i play it it stops on its own or plays the same photo over and over again i wouldn't recommend using this app for editing videos or photos it has been really glitchy lately and not working.
It’s amazing the things you can do with it is amazing!i use 24/7 to edit my roblox edits
Cap cut is really nice but it can get a bit confusing at start but when you go it’s really easy!
"I got to say CapCut is super good but the fonts aren’t too cool, and the effects are quite boring but another than that it’s doing great for me ! 
That’s all I think you guys should change."
I loved to edit stuff here but then my storage started to act up so I had to delete it I was sad but the storage was back
This is an amazing app! I’ve used it to make edit videos. The only thing I would like for you guys to add is motion blur! I love the graphs they are very good but they don’t look right without motion blur
So basically it won’t work when I try to get the app again but it’s the best app I’ve ever had! So I will give this a 5/5 anyway I hope it works soon <3
"This is just perfect ! I would like the ability to replace overlays, otherwise this is my favorite app"
"0/10 i do not recommend. I will share my experience with capcut, i tried editing my video the other day and when I came back my unfinished edit was deleted and I worked so hard on it it took me about a hour 10:43-11:56 and then also all my edits were deleted and i didn’t even finish most my edits"
"Hi! I really like your app, I was just wondering if you guys are planning to implement face/motion tracking, as the lack thereof can make editing difficult. Thanks!"
The editing software is good but when you import to your photos the quality is not that good like it’s blurry even when I put it to 4K looks the same
I love it but I’m trying to make a edit but it says no more space try to clean up some stuff but I only have 2 edit idk why it says that
"i finally found an app that i like to edit with. i’m learning how to do new things everyday and i’ve improved a lot over the months. tho only issue i have with this app is it takes up so much storage. i have to delete so many things just for this app. every once in a while i save the edits i want and delete the app. but it takes up so much space, you can’t get much else. besides that the app is great and works amazing!"
"I love this app so much and I think it’s one of the best editing app I ever used. But i live in iran and i cant use capcut:( idk why but the app says that i dont have internet connection ( wich i do) i even used vpn but.... nothing.
PLS HELP"
I would give it 5 but gifs don’t work can u make it so gifs work to because I don’t like wasting time recording clips and editing how long it is
"I love CapCut, I spend most of my time on it, but I can only make 4 projects and then it says to clear up my iPad storage, yet I only made 4 projects and my iPad is clear, and I know it takin* up half of my storage, please fix this. -Dakota"
"It was a great app at first, probably the best free editing app I’ve ever used, but recently whenever I try to do transitions or add effects it says no connection and won’t let me do anything. Might as well delete the app."
I love this app 100% but I feel like there should be more transitions and animation options. Also have different types of over layers.
This app is truly amazing! The way it edits your videos and seeing other people how their edits come out! It’s truly amazing. All the effects and transitions are very cool! 😍
"ok, I love this app. But when I’m adding photos,to an video, It takes me to a blank screen when I go to photos, But on the good side it’s a great app. You can do so much with it"
"This app is great, I make everything on here! It has an amazing world of creativity & customization. I have nothing to say except this is awesome!"
This is my favorite mobile editor I highly recommend it!
"Hello! I love your app but how do you update it? I really want the zoom 3D. It’ll make my edits look so cool! But please respond with an answer, I really want to know."
This is the best movie app EVER!!!! You can do so many thing add just audio of a video without the video and I love it just it needs better volume
"This app is PHENOMENAL! It has built in effects, NO watermarks, and AMAZING transitions. I use it for my edits. Sometimes I use funimate but I use capcut too. So I REALLY recommend this app. Especially for edits or videos."
"the app is usually great, but recently something has happened where i try to gather a clip from an old album, and when i go to watch the video to confirm it’s the one i want to add, it’s takes me back to my most recent photos. i can’t use any videos that are old and in albums due to this, please fix this i really love this app and use it almost every day"
CapCut is so smooth with its editing that I literally can make an edit without any lag and it’s easy to learn how to edit.
for an editing app it can do a lot not to mention i don’t have any watermarks or anything. there’s so much great about this app i love it so much
It’s a really good app but it wouldn’t let me edit a few photos and I rlly needed to edit them!
I give 4 star cuz I want kurdish font before this app u can write kurdish text but now we can’t please all my videos I edit with this app ! And I need to write kurdish text thank you💙
"An amazing app. I use it for my gacha videos (even though I don’t have a channel). A great app, and very useful too. I highly recommend!"
The app is very addicting and I love you very much but it does take a very long time to load in the video and younger people might not get it either way it’s a very fun app to use
Very good editing app for beginners I just got into editing and this app has helped me a lot I really recommend it if your new at editing
Easiest editing app I have ever used. You can use this for any social media platform including tik tok. Great is really all I have to say.
I love this app but can you make it support gifs? I always have to use another app or make it into video
It won’t allow me to select a Photos and it say could not import 😒
"I recommend this app for TikTok and videos you want to edit,I love this app I use it for TikTok and it improves my videos. In conclusion I recommend this app for Editing!"
I’m having trouble trying to add a top layer to my edit when it’s clear it’s shows the layer that’s not clear it’s probably me doing it wrong but it’s good so far!
i didnt watch ONE tutorial and i already made a nice video and the upload to tiktok feature is really good
"This editing software is very good. I think it can compete with most PC editing software. All the transitions, text styles, trimming, etc. is all very great."
I love this :) I can actually edit my videos for (TikTok) and do it quickly. thank you for making this so easy
I use it for all of my edits but the bling is not working anymore it keeps says WiFi when my WiFi is on so y’all need to fix that NOW
This app is such a unique one. I couldn’t ask for more and the fact that it’s all free! Why is this such an underrated editor?
Once when I found out about this app this app is 10 times better than PowerDirector
"I love this app , it’s meets all my needs in a editing app . Although I do wish they could update the bounces more a straight forward bounce instead of a sway out just a quick but good bounce out . Other then that I find myself to love this app .😁"
"I saw an ad for it on Instagram, it looked cool because of the effects like the boom or the lightning bolt, but I tried it and I can’t find ANY of those things. I am VERY annoyed and angry. If you advertise what your app can actually do, that would be a whole lot better for everybody! I will NOT be recommending it! THANK YOU!😡"
"It’s had finding great video editing apps like this one. I love it! The transitions, effects, and the ability to extract audio from videos, everything is amazing."
I love CapCut. It helps so much as a beginning editor. I’m a YouTuber and I was looking for an editing app and then I found this. If definitely deserves a five star rating.
"CapCut is amazing, however the style button isn’t there. 😭"
When i Opened CapCut there was no Style Button i asked my friends if they Didnt had it but they did i tried reseting my phone and deleting the app and downloading it back it but it never worked please tell me a reason why
Anywho I love CapCut it’s perfect but we need more filters more colors and other stuff but keep it up I love this app sm and I made over 60 edits this year and I’m happy ty 🫶🏾 .
"use to enjoy the app a lot but recently the enhance face smoother leaves a patch,  like lines accross your video which sought of makes it blurr , pls kindly fix dis so I can give you a 10/10"
The app does me a little bit more updates though
"I love this app, I edit on it every day! I recommend adding motion blur, and some more bouncy animations, if you get what I mean… but overall, since y’all added the smooth slomo I’m very impressed! Love ya❤️"
"Every time I import a new video, the beginning glitches visually. No amount of adjusting or splitting fixes it. I have tried dozens of videos and ones I have never had issues with and they are all glitching. Makes the app virtually unusable. Please fix this."
"I like CapCut but it’s not letting me do the velocity edit thing, I keep updating it and deleting apps to se did that helps but it doesn’t and people jus keep rubbing it into my face about it"
"I have a problem with capcut. I’m making something KINDA personal and my capcut keeps on crashing, lagging, and stopping my video from playing. Dev(s) of capcut, what do i do?"
The app is fairly easy to use but it could have more features!
Hi this app has helped me so much thank you so much for making this app idk what I would’ve done if I didn’t see this app.
I really love editing here but I hate it when i need storage so can you please remove that ty!
The Capcut app frequently shows a ‘does not have internet connection glitch which prevents it from accessing tik tok original sounds. This can only be fixed by downloading and redownloading the app.
It’s a good app I’d recommend using it but for some reason when I try to lower the opacity on text now it doesn’t work and I’m not sure why this just started happening
I’ve been looking for an app like CapCut that’s totally free and literally the BEST. This app is AMAZZINGG. I DEFINITELY recommend this to anyone in need of an editing app thats good and free and no need of in app purchases…<3
"If you could draw lines and stuff like that this would be my favorite 
Video editor in ipad"
"where do i begin.. it has so many options for effects, very easy to use, AND ITS COMPLETELY FREE. Like woah 😳 I love this app and use it to make edits everyday"
"I love the app in general, i love showing my friends my edits and the vids that i make. How do u post the vids on capcut to the thing?"
"Cool, love that everything is free but kinda does take up some storage so I just delete everything"
I love this editing app but sadly I can’t do animations. Idk if it is a world wide thing but I would really like to get this fixed thanks!
I love this app you don’t have to pay for it even tho is it good I am so happy I found the app keep it up CapCut is so good 😊
"i downloaded capcut yesterday and so far i love it! it has great music and everything but there is one thing that is kind of a big problem. whenever i go into the effects to put any effects on my video, it says i have no internet. each time that happens i check my internet and i have full bars. can you see if it is a bug?"
I absolutely love cap cut! My edits come out amazing with this and I’ve been using it for over a year. I do recommend making a smoother velocity/slow-mo.
"This is awesome! It sometimes glitches but otherwise it’s amazing, I wish you could use it without internet though it would be cool"
I really love capcut but you have to bring back the soft effect it was a really good effect so please bring it back !
"so i’ve been using capcut for a while and it’s become my main editing app. but ever since it was updated (a few months ago) the text became all weird. whenever i want to make it smaller, it looks all pixilated and messed up. i don’t know how to fix it so i just use another app for adding text. other than that, great editing app!!"
I had many projects but the update delete them all but other then that it’s good
"I’m so surprised, I used to think it was hard, just by looking at pics.
I readied the reviews

definitely download"
Can you let us use cap cut effects without cellular data cuz I was hoping for that
This app is Amazing! I use it pretty much everyday I use it for gacha life videos it’s perfect for text to speak thing and animations  I love this app!
I used this app for years loving it and one day I deleted and I tried downloading it again but I won’t download its saved it was loading for 2 days straight and I cant stop so I can rever use it again
I love it so much but one thing! It takes up a lot of my storage so To get this u might have to have a lot of storage so!
Okay this app is GREAT for beginners and its free! Most editing apps are big knock-offs that cost u lots of money which is not worth risking so ya I recommend this app its great!
Add some graphs and my edit keeps glitching please fix it and also I love. Just add some more graphs and transition and please make it so I can change color to like make it red thanks
this app is free without ads and it works so well! There are millions of stuff to use! definitely recommended for new editors who are on a budget!
This is a great app for me bc I just started editing but I do wish you can search up the animations/Effects
"You’re app is the best of video editing apps but why you’re don’t have this features 
• add custom fonts
• add Arabic font or Support Typing with AR"
"Don’t give me wrong I love everything about the app! My only problem is the key frames, they don’t have any easing curves. if you were to add that in the app, it would be PERFECT!!"
Best free editing app out there!!! I’ve been looking for something like this forever. It works great for being just a phone app.
I love the app I love all the transitions but y’all should add for the next update a key frame for the speed and stuff for the transitions
capcut is really simple to use n all but i suggest putting more text animations. i know developing takes a lot of work so you don’t have to do this but whenever i do text animations my picky self doesn’t really think the animations go well with my edits. maybe include the video animations to the text animations?
"first the good things: THIS APP IS AMAZING- I LOVE TO USE THE TRANSITIONS!!! I HAVR NO IDEA HOW TO USE VIDEO STAR SO THIS IS REALLY GOOD IN USE!!!
now to the upsetting / bad things...: i have to keep on deleting things i need just so that i can edit. I deleted toomany things just for this. Im quite upste abt this. Maybe you can change that for 
Me? TYSM!"
some reason i can’t add anymore videos or photos it’s bugging and sometimes i can’t close the animations and then i have to lose all my videos and delete the app just so i can use it again can you please get rid of that
It would be way better with a Apply All option
It’s a really amazing app and the thing I love the most is that there is no watermark and I really would recommend this thank you so much for this app!
This is so underrated! I came across this and I’ve been using it to do all my projects. It’s simple and actually works!
"for some reason, when I try to use the “bling” it keeps saying “internet connection lost” or something like that."
Okay...this is amazing ... LIKE THE ANIMATIONS ARE JUST 😍😍 AND FOR MOST ITS FREE ?!! SIXNHSHRURJFNDB I don’t have much problems except sometimes when I have a sound exported it kicks me out ? Not that much if a problem though ! Love it
"This app is so cool and helps with my editing but when I want to use the bling affect it says I, not connected to my internet and I have to delete it and re download it :/"
Its very very laging I tried to make a video and it kept on lagging and I tried to make it over and over again but it’s still laging please fix this bug.
"This is a great app but, the only thing I don’t like about it is that it sometimes kicks you out and it is really slow but other than that it’s a Great App!"
When I saved my edit it didn’t show it was just a fully black and I worked really hard on it:(
"I’ve had an issue with adding stuff like text bubbles 
It’ll always say I don’t have internet connection when my internet is perfectly fine"
"Hello, I just had a concern that my CapCut doesn’t have the feature “style” when I press on my video and I can’t do auto velocity. The app is really good for beginners"
"Fantastic app, very easy to use and multiple options for all needs!!! This is what I was looking for a long time!!! And all this is for free...veryy cool!!!"
This App lags too much it's not my storage because I literally have a lot of storage in my iPad is brand new so do not buy this I do not recommend worst app ever and apparently you have to have storage even though I literally have no pictures or videos in my camera roll again worst app ever
This app was really good until you guys started taking stuff away! You guys had good features and now they are gone? Please bring back the stuff you had taken away.
So I went to the app and watched some vids on it and the speed button on project was black what do I do
This is a good app I have had it for a while and the new updates are so good I would say you can make amazing edits in this app💛💛💙
This app is literally so amazing for editing and more. Once you learn how to do everything it’s very easy to operate!!
"I’ve been using CapCut for years and I see the add on auto velocity like it says on update log and I see how everyone else can use it but me
 And I am aware that I am not the only one who is having this problem, I have updated this app many times and still no velocity please fix your app."
"Easy to use and so fun, all the filters and transitions are so good, I also like the sound extracter and the speed effect"
"If I go to styles, it only gives me three.. please tell me why. Also I’m on ipad. Thanks!"
"I love all the fonts in CapCut. but… why is there not a HARRY POTTER FONT! please add a Harry Potter font, I would be so happy!!! It would make CapCut a 5 star instead of a 4 star. CapCut is a great editing app of course! 😂 thanks for thinking about adding it!!!"
My CapCut keeps freezing on the 12 second edits and I want it fixed if it’s me sorry for the convienence
It has good features but it doesn’t really get sounds from TikTok I linked it and it said o had no sound favorited when I had many favorites and it glitched on the audio
I have I loveeee this app but I’ve tried so hard to clean up storage like I deleted 2 CapCut videos around 100 videos and 3 apps/games and I still couldn’t edit you guys really need to fix that
It’s really good I’ve been use it for a year half but now every time I click all my videos are gone I have to start over again please fix it
"A good editing app. So many effects and fonts, templates that makes trends go around (such as habibi) 5/5 i suggest roblox and gacha people to install ✨✨"
"Everyone was using it, (mostly), I don't understand why you would remove it. One second its there for me and then gone forever, what happened? If its not removed, I know a lot of people suffering the same glitch. Please fix it, thank you."
"This app is very good and well for new users! But, when it comes to adding a ton of photos, for me, when I make them short and stuff and I play it some photos it stays on and glitches."
"Calcutta is the best editing app I have ever had you don’t have to pay for anything and they have so much stuff!! Cap cut is the best editing app ever! ✌🏻🎬🍿🎥.     

             Review by: {AVOCADO} 🥑"
It’s a great app but some things are hard to edit and work not like it’s glitching it’s just hard to find like where to re play
Everything about this app is great except one thing. I now can’t access my TikTok sounds. Id this would please be fix it would be greatly appreciated
the tiktok sounds feature is never working it always keeps on saying connect to an internet and try again
"Okay so I have been using CapCut for a long time and I think that you should add more affects like coloring or more affects that are trending! Thank you,"
AHH I have been yawing this app forever and I love how you can edit on here it’s honestly one of the best apps I’ve ever downloaded and everything is free!!!
It’s perfect and easy to use for beginners anyone can edit with this highly recommend
Allows 4k editing and beautiful effects/transitions and all they ask is for you to keep the watermark at the end 👍
I love this app but please make an easier way to do 3D things I see it in tiktok and ppl say I got the new update but I’m on iPad please do it for iPad I’m begging you
No need for update maybe make the price lower but please make a pc version
"There are no ads, and it has updates that are amazing I’m not gonna spoil it but if yo7 know how to use it then you should know it’s great😍😍😍😍"
I love capcut because you can edit amazing videos you can even edit your mom so yea that’s why I love capcut so much but I love my mom more but still I love capcut ❤️😘😍😊🥰💕💙💜💗🖤💛💖💞💚❣️💓😻🧡🧡💘💝
It would really help if someone could help me. It says that CapCut requires access to an album? But I don’t know how to do that. Please help
"This app is very fun a useful! But there is this glitch and sometimes stuff doesn’t pop up, otherwise I recommend!"
I love CapCut but for some reason it is making my edits have a background on them and I can’t remove them but overall a good app
So if you get a edit app you probably have to buy it but with this app not at all!!!!! You can add overlays and zoom in & more amazing stuff!
"It’s a very easy to use app, and it’s very good. But every time I open it and try to edit, it says my storage is full, which it isn’t. It glitches, and needs to be fixed"
When I was trying to animate the arms went in opposite places and it was moving by itself it didn’t help at all I waited the next day and it was still there. The text should have smoother lines
It’s great for my edits and videos even pictures but it just glitches a little bit but it’s great!!!!
"I use to like this app but not anymore i had to uninstall it and get it again bc the song played before the video played so it was a mess! So when I tried to get it it won’t let me and I almost am harmless, storage less, and photoless! Fix it!"
"This app is amazing but, I was wondering if you could add something to favorite or pin something. Like the animations"
But way way way this app makes me say it's brilliant like Adobe after effects in pc
I love it for beginners because i would find capcut cool if you could improve your edits like after effects
So I used this app for a very long time and it’s one of my favorite editing apps! If you reading this I love this app so much!
"I have made so many good edits with this app and people think it’s alight motion  lol. 

The only thing I’d say is please add graphs or something so that edits can be way better, thanks!! ❤️"
This is a grate editor don’t get me wrong but it’s a bit confusing at first but other then that it’s the best editor I ever had and that it’s free makes it way better
"I absolutely love this app but the one thing I’ve been hoping for is like a cosmic burn. Video star has this but I hate in app purchases. If cap cuts reading this rn, please add a cosmic burn!! 😁"
"It’s a very good app for editing but there is a lot of things that annoy me ,
#1 when I try opening a photo it just gives me NONE of my photos please fix that, it is my only problem,"
I think you should be able to favorite transitions because I takes so long to get to some.
"I’ve been using this app for a couple months, and I love it! It works perfectly it’s easy to use!"
"This app is really good! I recommend this for all the beginner editors and for all! Thank god for this app, it has help me for animating too, I love it!"
Its really good it can make super good edits but one thing i think would be good is graphs and being able to like flip and maybe a squish and shake transition
"Don’t get me wrong, CapCut is great for edits and has multiple layers. It’s really easy to use and is good for beginners. However, they could add graphs to make better, smoother transitions. All in all, great but basic, app."
It was really nice and I was going to say theres like lots of cool features and I would love more stuff like this I think this is the best app😯😧🤭
"Yes, I grew with this app! I just want some tips, for great editing. It’s so great are fun to use, this is a rich and healthy app. I love this app! But may some updates? But keep the style, keep growing!"
"Capcut Is a great app for me I love how they don’t have a water mark and how easy it is. But whenever I try to get an effect It says Im not connected to the internet so can you please fix that,"
This app is so awesome but it’s needs more transitions and filters and that stuff but it’s a amazing app cause it’s free and it has no  watermark
"This is the easiest app to edit with! And i also share it with tiktok! 
Download this app its really cool and easy to edit with!"
honestly it’s so hard to find a good app that is good for edits and this is LITERALLY PERFECT I could not ask for something better honestly it’s just perfect 11/10
"Don’t get me wrong, this app is amazing! But I have one problem. There isn’t enough layers for me to put all my pictures. I like to tween/animate on this app and their isn’t that much layer for me to put all of the screenshots. Amazing app though!"
I made a edit and it kept freezing the video and it wouldn’t show up and it was really frustrating and I just really want to finish the edit and it wouldn’t let me so this is why am leaving two stars
"I just started using capcut and its pretty good. The only problem is that when I put a picture layer, it makes it blurry. I like to use green screen on my videos, but it makes the outline kind of pixelated."
I have made many things on this app it’s great!!!But the sad thing is it’s that if you have a 40 min video it takes a while to export!:(
I m a amv editor or anime editor I would love if you can put extra things that other editors may use
"I can simply say it is “The Best” app!
From simple video editing, to professional, it got it all, huge thanks for the developers ❤️"
"Really like this app is awesome
but i hope you guys support Arabic language in text and typing.

Thank you."
"My app got offloaded by my phone and it reset all of my projects (40+) and I tried signing in with TikTok but it says that it’s already signed into another account, any way I can fix this?"
"I honestly love CapCut, It’s just so amazing and easy! Me and my WHOLE family love it! I have no questions or anything else, Again amazing!"
"Great editing app! It took a me a few days to get the hang of it, and now that I do, it’s amazing! Definitely recommend!"
"So yesterday I was going to add a splice filter, but when I opened it, it just said normal with a draggy thing. I dragged it but it only changed the opacity of the overlay. Idk if this is a glitch or an update. Really sad but great app overall. 💔"
So i love cap cut its the best editing app ever. But however everytime i  put like 15 pics or some what it tells me try again like please fix that but other than that great app highly recommend
"I had updated the app to see the new changes, and it put the style back to what you originally had. Please fix this issue, I enjoy using Capcut, but if this problem can’t be fixed I’ll just stop using the app all together. Thanks."
It could use some better animation better keyframe use and still smoother velocity.
I’m sad you guys don’t have wobbly screen effect where your video is flouting and wobbling
"It’s free easy to use 
I highly recommend this app to edit and do other things <3"
The sound keep saying no internet try again and I can’t fix it
Hey I’ve been using CapCut for at least two years now. Idk if they added it yet because I haven’t updated the app yet. But PLEASE add a smooth slow mo. (Pretty please.)
Everytime I make an edit the next day even though I delete the edits it won’t let me and it says I have no storage.
"I love the shortcut version but the that feature stopped working. Deleted it, reinstalled and it’s no longer an option"
"App is super good for editing, but there is one problem.

Whenever I connect it to my tik tok account for music, I get only SOME of my favorited audios. How come I don’t get all of them? Please fix this issue"
"I love you. And I love the parents that created you. Without them there would be no you, and there would be no app. 

I love this app!"
"I used this app for a long time, but every time I try to make something new after a while, it doesn’t let me and my data and stuff is all good, I tried to un download it worked but still wont let me now"
"It’s great app for beginners and it’s free but if you wanna get better at editing use different apps that coast money like video star pro , alight motion and vsco"
"I was looking for a good free montage app, whan I found capcut I was really amazed by what you can do by it and all for free , I really appreciate it and I hope it still free 🥰🤍"
"Can you fix the graphs? I try to use it to make a picture move for key frames but every time I try to use it, the prompt will not go away telling me what to use it for."
I love that Cap-cut is so easy for editing I don’t have to stress out when I’m working on editing it’s the best edit app for beginners I love cap-cut!
Literally thank you for making this free you made my day and I’m in so much joy. Thank you for existing!❤️
I’m still a beginner but I love editing this made my TikTok gain some followers but I’m staying like this I would recommend this app
it just need graphs and you you capcut add those you know who much people will wanna download trust me graphs  will change the game  and all that the app is cool great  JUST PLS ADD GRAPHS and do it fast 😤 bec people cant afford ae video star pro  HAVE YOU SEEN AOME OF THE CAPCUT EDITS WITHOUT GRAPHS DUDE IF YOU GIVE THEM GRAPHS IT A WIN WIN 🥇 THX FOR READING HAVE A GOOD DAy
Capcut is an amazing editing app and can help you with anything it loads really quick and has very fun effects .
Well I was editing but I wanna ask can you please add more effects to make videos with please! It would be great but capCut your still good!!
"I enjoy using cap cut! it is so easy to use and you can make edits easily. I think it would be even better if there was a smoother slo mo. but, other than that… it’s great!"
I always want make a gacha video but after one video I have to delete a lot of apps so I have to delete it over and over
hiii my name is jayde and i just wanted to say a few things i love about capcut i just love its not one of those apps that says its editing when really its not capcut is a real editing app and i love how many filters it has and effects and animations and overlay i use capcut for editing all the time for tik tok edits roblox edits and photo edits i just love capcut whoever invented it tysm for inventing it
I love capcut but we need the option to make  our animations faster or slower or just give us new animations
"You guys are a good app it’s just does not let me make vids I’ll have only 199 photos and I still can’t because my “phone has no storage” like just let me save it. But in all, it’s a good app:)"
"This app is truly amazing. It’s sooo easy to use, and you don’t have to pay to get extremely good content thank you CapCut!!"
"For some reason, every time I try to use auto captions, it tells me that there’s an error and I don’t know why?"
It doesn’t allow us to use filters since it showing no internet connection. I tried many times but doesn’t work. I switched between mobile data and wifi thus does not work. Since what is the use of this app if we cant use these effects
"I love this app so much! I love how there’s no watermark, everything’s free, and it’s so easy to use. This is one of the best editing apps I’ve ever used!"
I love this app! But it’s really annoying because if I try tapping on the clip to add an effect it doesn’t let me and that’s frustrating! Please fix it!!!
I love the app but when we have good storage or our storage is full capcut keeps telling us to fix that we fix it it’s the same god dang thing when our storage is good it just tells us that just please take that off and let us make a project please please I’m tired of that k so please improve capcut.
I love this app so much especially since they added the new short cuts edits. There are so many cool templates and I highly recommend this app.
"I just Got It 2 months Ago Didn’t Know Anything but I got So Much better editing Probably The best Editing App Out there!!!! No Glitches No Adds, It’s the best"
I use the app for my fan pages and I have never had a problem with it
This app is good and is the only thing I edit in it is easy but hard and that  makes it fun
Capcut is and amazing app but if they added more effects it would have been amazing!😅❤️
I love this app so much I have made a lot of videos on it and I just wanted to say that beginners should use this app😌✌️✨✨
Whenever I try to put a price together it says that it can’t import. So now I can’t make any edits but other then that it’s a good editing app
I love love love (and the love goes on) this app! It lets you extract the audio from different recordings and import them into other videos! I’ve never EVER DONE THAT WITH ANY OTHET APP! I love love love it so so much! Tysm to the people that made it GOD BLESS YOU! ♥️
"So I was wondering if you can add this:

You can have as many edits/ videos as you want

And that’s it if you can do it!"
I love this app it’s so great it’s amazing so many futures and watermark free!! And it’s especially so easy to use I love it so much it makes it so much easier to make edits
The app is easy to use and the edits i make look good but i would like to see if maybe you can add transitions like in Alight Motion It’d make my edits look better Thxs!😁
I absolutely love this app! No other app is near as good! Ever since I downloaded this app I fell in love! There are so many cool editing tools! Keep up the good work!
"Oml has no watermark! You can crop videos! And the stickerrssssssss,lol and everytime i i get a watermark from some other app i crop it with this one ;)"
I have never edit on an app so good before! This app is so amazing and so absolutely perfect! I totally recommend this app!
Hello. Ima be honest this app helps me edit my yt vids and it’s very useful but one thing I hate is at the end it says editied by cap cut and it ruins my videos if Ima be honest so maybe a options to delete it
"I have been using this app for over a week now and let me say, it is the best (free, no watermark) editor I have ever used! It has awesome features."
I love the app but there is something wrong when I want to make a edit with my photos it comes out black and when I got to videos it shows up please fix this
The app is good and great you can add videos and stuff and yeah butt..I need help because when I import a video or sound it says ‘’try again later’’ and you help me?
"i like the app but like- i’ve been having the app telling me that there’s not internet yet i’m literally connected to my wifi and it’s been happening for a long time and it won’t let me finish editing my video. so you know how for the stickers it shows the picture of how the sticker looks like? well it doesn’t show up but when i click it, it loads forever:("
"I love this app! It’s super helpful and easy to use which I love, but wish there was a way to make ur own transitions with motion blur, so basically a setting to add motion blur would really help."
"Suggestions
There should be a thing where you can stretch the video out.
I don’t know why but I watched some videos with the stretched and it looks a lot cleaner

Also to get music I wish you can search up the song title and get the song

Overall this app is so good it makes editing 100 x more fun"
This app helps my skating edits honestly all the other apps where hard to make but this is the best I’ve used ever don’t get rid of it it’s AWSOME💯
the style button isn’t showing anymore how do o fix it I want to do the cyberpunk edit howww HOW PLEASE
"So I went to Capcut to edit a video and There was no Style Button or splice button, They were gone.. Please put them back I didn't want to see them go."
I love your guys app but where is the style option??????
I seriously love this made multi edits y’all should really download this it’s an amazing app and it wouldn’t let you down unlike Funimate. ❤️👍
There is not a lot of filters for your face! Please make more filters not just ones like makeup. Like the one with the stickers on your face or something. Just make more please. Otherwise it’s a good app.
Capcut is great but I’ve seem to not have templates.. I’m trying to make habibi edit but I can’t find the template.
this is literally the only app that isnt all about “in app purchases” !!! it’s completely free with amazing transitions for videos and the templates option… GENIUS!!! I LOVE THIS APP THANK YOU
"Hello CapCut owner, So thank you for bringing ur app into this world! It’s Very easy to use & it helps me to do Gacha videos,Edits and all kinds of stuff! People are experts at these, Soo I might want you to add one puny thing.. A tutorial, Because sometimes People wanna just know how the app works and all the details so then can Animate and more! So yeah that’s all

Gooday!

&

Stay safe 😷"
"This is not easy to use especially for beginners, really get your advertisement fixed."
"CapCut only wants to work right sometimes and it never lets me remove the background from pictures. It just says, “sorry, try again later”."
This app is all great but one thing is I don’t have templates? Whenever I sign in to Capcut then the template is disappeared. I hope you guys can fix this problem!
"I love making edits with Cap Cut, they make it easy.  I also love making home films!"
This app is the best thing that came in my life I really recommend 10/10!
This app is really easy to use! Its not hard unlike video star! Try it out!
So I updated capcut and! It didn’t work- so please fix this bug! Thank you so much capcut!
"So CapCut is good but there is just on problem, sometimes when I was to in add a overlay and I click on it, it say you have no photos but I do."
"So when I choose my images for the shortcut edit, it doesn’t load. It either gets stuck at 86% or 100%."
So easy to use and actually free unlike most video apps all features are free to use and minimal adds!!!!🤩🤩🤩
"It is so easy to edit videos on CapCut! I can do Roblox edits and make shaders and use overlays, which is extremely helpful!"
I love this app and it helps me sm but their should be a search bar to help get around the effects and things faster!
I have enough storage to make a edit but it says I don’t have enough storage and I want to make a edit but I can’t
"So technically every time I do a screen recording on roblox,
It would save but then I would go on CapCut and see that it says no storage and I check my camera and then i do have storage.
Fix It Please-"
"Good app for editing if ur a beginner but it has so many bugs and it makes it impossible to even edit, its so annoying please fix that."
I love this app it’s so easy to use but when I change the speed a little slower it’s not very smooth so I would love if you guys to make it smoother.
CapCut you Ben saying my storage is full don’t even let it say that let it have you still make videos bye
"Anytime there a black screen the text you add doesnt show no matter what style or color you make it, it will not show its really annoyinh honestly and if you try to make a video more than 1080p 30fps itll stop loading then you have to delete the app its really annoying."
"I love how easy and simple it is to use, while having lots and amazing features!"
For the record I love the app but it is kind of broken I can put my transparent photos on it anymore I still like it but I have some different feelings about it
"This is awesome. But whenever I try importing audio for gacha club memes. Apparently it says "" Video Format Not Supported? "" my friend can submit the music fine and I can’t?"
I love the app and it's amazing٫ but I accidentally deleted something I've been working on for awhile. Please add an area with projects you've deleted (like instagram)
i got done with one AND IT SAID DO YOU LIKE EYES WHY JUST WHYY NO I DONT BUT WHYYYYYYY thank you I hope I don’t see it again and if I was 4 and I could read super good I would have screamed so that was creepy I did not like it idk how it got there I don’t want it to happen again so ya creepy
"CapCut is a really good app but I think you should add graphs and I maybe add more transitions! Other than that, I love the app, and it's incredible!!!"
I try to use cap cut to edit but it says no internet connection error one day I got so exited cause it was finally worked but the next I come in and it says no internet connection I prefer KineMaster or Alight motion then CapCut you can make good edits with it if it works so I say just don’t use your storage for the stupid app
I love it great for editing videos like gacha life gacha club vlogs and more!i love it thank you for making this app I am great full for it and ever thing else❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
:(
There is a Glitch where the ending appears 30 minutes into the Capcut thing and you can’t add the ending again
I absolutely love this app. It helps so much when it comes or editing its amazing i general has great featured and makes my edits look great
"It would be the perfect app if it didn’t glitch so much. I love this app so so much, it’s completely lovely, and completely free. But just make it stop glitching!! 😭"
I like the app it just says that I have too much storage then I delete 100 things and it still says I have too much storage.
"So I LOVE this app because, all of my friends ext. use it for awesome edits! But this is where it goes wrong, so whenever I get this app, it says I don’t have internet so I can’t edit! :( But I DO have internet and I have deleted it and reinstalled it!! But it still doesn’t work!! Please help me!! :("
I use this to edit so many of my favorite characters and it is easy to use!
I love this app it’s great for editing but very time I want to post an edit it always gets delayed
It’s been say delete photos or videos I have too many times and it still won’t work but when it doesn’t do that I like
"This app is great for beginners like myself as other apps like vs, am, ae, those are like the middle. Graphing is what people usually use while editing"
"I love this app it’s amazing no watermark, all free, and good transitions. There are a few bugs right now my screen doesn’t work only in CapCut so they can fix that"
This app is great! If you want to get into editing this is a great start! You do not have to pay anything to make great edits! Highly recommend!
It’s a good app to use but could you guys make more combo animations transitions instead of the 3D ones please I would appreciate it
This is a really great app I’m glad I found it but something that severely pisses me off is that it constantly kicks me out and it is very slow. At this point it’s sort of heard to use the app as this is a reoccurring problem.
So I have been using cap cut a lot and for some reason it says no internet connection so can y'all please fix
"I love this app so much! I love the fact that EVERYTHING is FREE! Meaning, the transitions, effects, filters, fonts, stickers, and so much more! This is exactly what more people need for edits😊"
The app really great but it’s started to not work for me like nothing loading and it’s not my WiFi fault
if you are looking to make edits get this! it’s so fricking good for that! Unlike video star it is easy to use and the finished product looks amazing!
Since all this quarantine I’ve been spending a lot of time making edits and this app has been the best! Thanks
Took a little while to learn to use but I figured it out and it is a good app 👍
It’s a great app but for some reason my style option went missing whenever I want to animate a photo. How do I fix that?
"When im slowing down a video, there is green flashes!? i dont why this is happening but its annoying. Please fix it"
What happened to the style button I can not find it anywhere this is a complaint
I can’t find the style option on my CapCut app what happened to it
I’ve been using capcut for a year and till now the app has been delaying when I try to edit I can’t keep track of the beat everytime I try to edit and idek if it’s the app or if it’s my phone bcuz I got a iphone6s and it’s really trash but can u try to fix this if you can for me
When I add my tiktok songs on this app they don’t work I have to like wait a hour for my tiktok songs to load
"The new update has absolutely destroyed the stabilization feature which was the main reason I was using this app
The videos are still so shaky even with it turned up all the way. Before the update it used to be perfect"
"When I try to make a video, it tells me I have to “allow access to photo albums” and when I hit confirm, it leads me to settings. However, in settings there isn’t an option to give access to photo albums. Disappointed I can’t use this app."
So i saw the new update and when i clicked it i didn't see no changes what do i do??
CapCut I need help getting the velocity effect. It only shows the three effects for me. Please help!
The way I use this app is perfect for me I don’t have any problems with it at all
"This app has made me edit more often, thing is I can't make anything on it. I'm a beginner and have to make things / videos on photos or tik tok, that's why I use KineMaster a bit more"
I love this app a lot it not only edit. You videos but it helps you get better I think it’s a good app
"This is a very good app I came across, was looking for an app I can make myself that was free and luckily I found this"
It works extremely well until it only exports videos 3min and under I can’t even edit me videos for Vlogmas 😐😕
I added a vid and some random text popped up and said:im not on group today because I want the one with Michelle our relationship is strong but im against everyone who has had the same game. IM NOT KIDDING 😞😭😭😭😡
"This is an amazing app. If you are looking or a free, easy to use, video editor, then this is the app. It has the best transitions. AND IT IS FREE. Like there is no better f"
Overall really good app but it always says I need space but I have tons but overall pretty good
This app is sooo good I recommend to get it it is a free editing app I love is so much just can’t explain BUT it needs a little work but super good app
"When I open it, it tells me I have no storage. Which I deleted all my videos and screenshots and it still said I had no storage. So please fix this glitch because I have never tried capcut and I do want to try it. Thank you"
The app is amazing or editors… but for me it always says “insignificant storage” and won’t let me do ANYTHING unless I get rid of edits until I have like 2. So ya that’s all
Well i love this app but I use it to upload yt videos but when I upload them there low quality
"It’s okay, however the video and audio are very delayed from each other, and it’s hard to know where I’m supposed to put things"
I really like this how even if you close ur phone ur edit is still saved. I Really Enjoy 😊 👍🏼
"Literally the best app I’ve used frfr, it helps with music videos and overall does an amazing job!"
"It was going good until one day, I was editing a video for my tiktok, I took a break so I was gonna save it, it didn’t save the project so I did it again, still didn’t work, please fix this bug :("
"Great app! I use it for my videos, 10/10 would recommend! Super easy to learn how to use!"
Now I’m not able to download all my videos to my phone once they get to 69% it kicks me out of the app. I hope they fixes it cause it’s a good app
"Ever time I want to edit it say.”insufficient storage full try again” so I go see if I have storage. And I do    
And I don’t like how it says that but other then that it so easy to learn. And so helpful"
I had trouble with this app at first but I got used to it I also loved the 3D photo thing that’s all!
This is a great editing tool to use this is the best editing app I ever had this app helps me with my Roblox editing videos!
Overall the app is pretty okay. I don’t get why it’s so complicated to use though. I have a hard time trying to figure out the meanings of the animations and why couldn’t you just say Opacity instead of splice?
This is AMAZING 🤩 you guys have the best app I recommend this to anyone who wants to edit and I got the controls down pretty easily!
This editing app it really great it soo cool but... there is one little thing when I mean “one little thing” I wish there could be no WiFi/Internet like I wanna edit in the car when I’m out or if I’m out somewhere that was no internet I could edit without WiFi/internet that would nice ;) anyways that’s all.
"This app is really good, but I do get annoyed a lot when the app starts to lag. so maybe if they could fix that some how that would be great yes."
"This app is amazing! It’s really simple, but can make amazing edits! I use it a lot for my edits and
it is *chefs kiss*✨
I definitely recommend this app!"
It’s ok but it doesn’t let me click some of the buttons like text and overlay sadly it’s a good app but those are annoying thing that I have
When you make the video go slower it’s laggy please fix the problem there app is great tho I been using it for almost 8 months
"I love this app💙 I think you should use it! It’s free and there’s no watermark, it’s better than any other app I’ve used😊"
"I was just editing and for some reason, none of the buttons on the bottom work?"
"So I love capcut, it’s awesome, it has every thing I need, but, the style icon won’t show up. Please fix this, it’s happening to my friend too."
"This app is amazing, no matter what people say it’s my favorite. On Tiktok, I’ve used this app for overlays and now I’m OBSESSED with doing overpays thanks to this app! ❤️✨🌸thank u for this WONDERFUL App!"
I love the app I really do but for some reason every Time I try to do something it says no Internet connection when I clearly have Wi-Fi or data. I know it’s not me because it works when every other app except this one.
I love this app so much it’s really easy to edit there so much stuff you can chose from
"Easy to use, no watermark and amazing speed configuration. There’s room for improvement, I would love to see 60 FPS added."
"Saw this on IG ads and gave it a try... This is by far the best editing apps ever... It got all the nice features such as, cool transition, animation, many more things to use... and it’s all FREE without WATERMARK"
Y’all need to stop updating CapCut it does not need more stuff and when u update stop taking Style..
Amazing editing app- but the style button won’t show up :(
there’s a problem with some videos I put on There to edit what happens is it is pitch black and it’s annoying so please fix this!!
I kinda like this! It has better effects!
A must have for gacha videos you Are Better Than Kinemaster All Free And Amazing U Take So Much Time Into Making The App Thank U We Love U So Much So Easy To Use 💕
The app is good but I was using this effect called electric light border and the next day the effect was gone for me I looked everywhere for it 😔
Ik i seem like and idiot but whenever I put on auto velocity it does quick black flashes im begging you please fix this im to lazy to do real velocity
"As a YouTuber and Tiktoker, I use it for every single video first I take screenshots and then go to Capcut and add texts and effects, this is perfect for editing!"
It’s very nice if you are looking for something to edit with use this app!😀 it’s free and fun it’s like TikTok but kid and teen friendly so if your parents don’t let you get TikTok or Snapchat get this!
"I haven’t got the update for the new styles, is there a way I can fix it?"
THE BEST most easiest editing app I’ve ever used!! No watermarks on the videos and so easy to figure out totally recommend!!!
I was just exporting a long video then 97 percent yay but the battery went to 20 percent boom I have to restart can you fix that does not happen pls plssss
"I love the app. I use it for so many things! It’s so easy to get ! And you’ll get good edits out of it I love this app so make sure to get it!,"
This app is good but fix this thing right now so there is this one glitch and it’s so annoying when I use the key frames and use the graphs it ruins the whole edit so fix it RIGHT NOW OR I DELETE CAPCUT 😡😡
They need to find a way to share different projects with other devices.
"Hoi, I love Capcut, but I would like it if you could add multiple select for the overlay, thank you."
The background feature doesn’t work like it use to and I can barley make videos without it now it’s been like this for soo long idk how you guys did not fix it yet
I have tried to take a song from tiktok multiple times and it keeps saying no internet connection. Connect to the internet and try again. The thing is I am connected to the internet and it is still not working
The app has potential but has a lot of issues…the biggest issue is that it glitches the videos you import it un syncs the audio with the video and cuts off the beginning and end just slightly which is very frustrating and confusing
I can’t download it idk why I used to be able to but now I can’t but it’s good 10/10
So basically I am a tiktok we and it really helps me do stories but I recommend this for stories on tiktok and stuff but I don’t really do edits like that
It Has Really good Effects and editing but every time i use it it always says Delete Storage Which I hate but Great app! I would suggest to use it for edits
Great app and all but it may need some more graphic features and accessibilities. Also some more audios would be great!
I can’t believe how good this works!!
Im trying to voice over a video but my voice doesn’t seem to go through.
Really good for editing videos or image’s highly recommend to everyone
"This app is very easy and useful to use, it’s great if you are trying to start editing. Overall good!!"
I was a beginner making Roblox edits and now I’m a pro and it’s only been 3 weeks I really recommend this app to all ages
"In my opinion capcut is extremely impressive but I just want one thing, Δ negative filter, like that would be so dope to have please add it!"
Every single app with smooth slow motion cost money. What would make this app go incredibly viral would be if capcut added smoother slomotion!
Is a great app for editing but when we talk about slow motion it gets kinda wierd
Every time I mess up a video I want to redo it so click on photos and it doesn’t show me the photos anymore so I always have to delete and download it back so fix this😕
Why is every sound effect in Chinese?
Best app ever you can upload videos on 4K and 60 FPS like no other app and you don’t have the credits to CapCut on the bottom
"I do indeed love this app, but recently my auto-captions have not been working, would love to have this fixed"
It’s an amazing video editing app you should try it guys
"what more can you ask for! no watermarks, mostly everything you need is free, easy interface, i had a great experience! only slight problem i had was i could not upload audio clips from my phone, but there were workarounds. only used for 1 video, but experience was great!"
I just downloaded this app and it is really cool and there are no fees it is completely free and easy to use I recommend
"CapCut is a great app, just sometimes it overheats my device a bit too much because of how many overlays and effects I use. I love the transitions, there’s no watermark, and it’s free! That’s amazing."
"I like it but everytime I download it, it keeps saying you need to free up space and I barely have no apps for pictures and it’s been happening and it’s frustrating 😒"
Cap cut is the best editing app ever is very easy to use it has multiple options to chose from and is very helpful.
"I love this app but
When ever I try and put another photo (not overlay) there’s no photo option
Please update this :)"
I’m going to be completely honest here I only got this editing software so I could make sugarcrash edits
Bro this doesn’t have 5 stars give it five stars this editing software is awesome
"This app is so amazing! It’s easy to video edit, no watermarks, no adds. It’s just all you could ask for!"
I’m a editor on TikTok and this was my first time using capcut and the edit came out amazing the downfall is that when I finished half of the videos where glitching
3 stars at the start it was going good it was easy to work with then like at the middle it like stopes it didn’t let me like shorten the clip and sometimes it doesn’t let me at all and it’s a little glitchy but it’s alright
This app is amazing and I use it for anime edits. But you should add Red Alert but with all colors. It would be amazing but keep it up :)
"Yes, this app is good but they took away style and now I’m sad. I can’t do velocity no more and I can’t get famous on TikTok. 😡😡😡😡 this app is so good but bad because of one thing they took off. 😤😤😤

Wait nvm"
The glitch is fixed! Thank you!
I love this app because I can make fun videos and I can’t add sounds that the app already does not have so 5 stars for sure!
"I really like everything about this app and how easy it is to use. 

Some of my suggestions are the opacity of stickers & pictures should be added. 

More fonts & colors for the letters. 

Definitely add more stickers please because I love all of them! 

Overall it’s great app and hope to see more improvements!"
"this app is literally everything i needed in just one app, it’ll make editing so much easier for me, ty 😭✨💖"
Capcut is an easy editing app/tool I use it everyday and I don’t get tired of it so If you need an editing app download capcut 🤍🖤
"This app is amazing for editing and has almost all the tools you need to make amazing edits, but what ever happens to the style button?"
Thank you. 😌🙏
"CapCut is and amazing app considering it's 100% free. My suggestion is: auto velocity flash. This is basically auto velocity, but on the beat it also flashes. that is it."
"its a lovely app, but im really looking for a blur effect, like from video star. Id start using it more if it had an effect like that!! :))"
i love the app but the newer features wont show for me even though i updated the app which is weird
"It’s an amazing app that everyone should try , we need more good apps like this"
"It’s a great app, but it bugs out when I try to import a video of some sort."
I use this app. I live in New York. But this says no internet connection. Why? I deleted and installed. Stilll says it. And It only says it for audio
People think capcut is bad but it’s a very good app! You do not have to pay you can remove the watermark and make cool edits!
I have a question why will it not let me update my app?
I love it because it’s so easy to try to do editing so I love it so much it’s really really fun...I love it so much
"You can do almost anything on this app including, animation,intros, and cute edits. This app gives you many guides and labels everything."
"Hi!! I just downloaded Capcut for the Auto-Velocity feature but cannot seem to get it to work. Do I have to pay for the auto-velocity? I uploaded my video of 14 seconds, pressed edit then pressed style. There was no auto-velocity option and whenever I pressed a style, it told me that my clip can’t be adjusted. PLEASE HELP ME!!!"
"I’ve been using CapCut for most of my Tiktoks, and it is AMAZING! It’s super simple yet makes such good edits! Definitely would recommend."
"Good game but, 12+ and older? That does not seem right. I’m younger then 12 and I’m really good at editing! I think it’s that you should change that you for your time! Bye!"
It keeps showing me a photo from the start every time I cut it please fix that
"So it said I couldn’t make a project because of storage, so I deleted some apps and videos! When I came back it sill said it! So please get rid of this"
This app is pretty good for an editing app but there are some things they have to put in the app. I suggest adding graphs which can help the editor a lot.
Seriously it’s so good I can make the best highlights  and no lag comes in! This is a easy 5 star for starters/pro’s.
O M G! Cap cut is an amazing editing and video making app when I first started Gacha and other things it helped a lot I learned a lot from capcut and cool tricks :)
It doesn’t let me edit but everything for cap cut I have on and it keeps saying “in need of album” when I allow it but it’s a good app if I could use it
So when I try to edit I do down and it only lets me do it for 1 second so it’s not really an edit so it’s getting me upset because I can’t even edit now.
It’s a good app but it says that you need WiFi to add an effect but I have WiFi also it just now started saying that I don’t have enough space to simply watch a video I made
This is a awesome app because it’s free and has everything like star video I mean I’m a really slow beginner
"This app is amazing and I highly recommend it for beginners the only problem is I lost all my projects when I went into cap cut today
:("
Ok so I deleted every single one of my video and I only had a video with like 5 clips and it said full on storage like bruh I cant even make anything now going to IMovie now ;)
It’s a good app to edit I use it for my channel haven’t fully made my channel yet tho it’s gonna be called fifigames so yeah bye great app
This app is pretty buggy and i hate when i click photos and it says i have none when i do and the app is so dramatic about the storage
The app is a really good editing app but I am kind of disappointed that you need a lot of storage to save or to make videos. Other than that I can edit‘ and do a lot of cool stuff and make good edits.
"I love making edits. Great app. 

Sometimes whenever i want to make an edit it says I need more storeage when my store age is half full. Please fix this"
"This app is really handy for video editing, but how do I solve the no internet connection problem? I can’t do anything else with this app except add videos. Please respond."
The app is great but can you please make it a option that can make effects fade in and fade out
I love this app but all I want is for you to add more text to speech voices we need kid ones and sum cute girl one or a UWU girl voice?
"This app has really great features but I have a problem. When I set an animation for my own sticker, it doesn’t play when I start the video. Any way I can fix that?"
"It’s a amazing app I love it!but it always says that my storage is full even know I pay to have all my photos I dont,appreciate how it dosent let me edit."
This app is so cool I can do so much and do so much editing. I made so many cool TikToks with this app and I really think it deserves 5 stars
"So, i've been editing for months now on vllo and kinemaster so i wanted better transitions and i heard capcut has em. but the transitions won’t work! it keeps saying i have no wifi but i do! it annoys me a lot…"
"I LOVE THIS APP!!! Capcut is constantly being updated and improved, and I think that maybe the app would benefit by having a smoother slowmo?
Otherwise,
Its amazing!"
Once you learn how to use EVERYTHING...this app is better than iMovie ... I said what I said! The editing that you can do is 🔥
I love this app it amazing but I did the new update for a edit and it still won’t let me use  3D zoom I’m confused and i really need to do an edit
"Because when I delete picture, it’s still here! KEEP IT UP!!!"
"My video when I zoomed in was soooo glitchy looking!
Also, the background removing does not even work I see sooo
Much green screen whenever I try to erase the backround."
"I love the app but when I make a video it sometimes slows down, freezes and glitches but overall it is a great app! 😊"
Better than iMovie and doesn’t ask u to pay for crap. Love it.
Best editing app ever the only thing I would change would be to add a lot more affects
Does anyone know how to get 3d zoom effect. I press on style but the 3d zoom effect isn’t there.
This is the stupidest app I’ve every seen I have to delete like almost all my photos and they are all memory’s I will never forget it’s so stupid how you have to delete all your photos just to make one single video. You should make a feature where it wouldn’t do that :)
Hi! I love this app there is no watermark and free cool transitions. But just can maybe add more cool transitions because I literally used all of them now I’m getting kind of bored but so far good app keep it up! Love it!
I love to use CapCut because the effects and everything is 10/10. And I love to use it because it’s free!
"This app is actually awesome! I love it and it’s so easy to do the transition, it’s free to! So all I’m saying is...Get the app because you will love it😙✌🏻"
This app really helped me with my creativity there was a lot of choices and I love this app really recommend
"I got this app like a couple months ago, and it’s already such a great editing app!"
"App is good but when I put too many photos and just one part and I come back at it’s lagging so bad almost every day this like that, that’s what I hate about it but meanwhile this app is amazing!!"
I freaking love this app no water mark easy to edit things and free music this has helped me a lot!
The app is really good and I make lots of edits in it but I’m trying to make a edit using an affect but I’ve made a edit setting the duration to the lowest and now it’s stuck at 0.1s
At first it was good then it started bugging me to update it so I ignored it cus I’m lazy but then some of the things wouldn’t work I couldn’t Evan edit it so note to self just update it
"this app is really really good, i enjoy editing on capcut. but, i have a problem with the split option. like sometimes i’ll miss-split, do some editing with backgrounds to soon realize i can’t undo the split. please make it so that you can “recover split” or something like that. other than that, this app is great :)"
Its 100% free and amazing plus awesome transitions definatly recommend getting
Okay I’m sorry for this one start review but I can’t do anything on this app! It won’t let me add anything- it’s just sucky for me- I’m not sure if it’s my phone or what I just think that not the app itself but whatever’s going on with it! Because my friend has this app and it works good for them! So I don’t know.
Okay so I re-installed CapCut because when I click “Text” it doesn’t appear. I got it back and it did the same thing.
Capcut is a really good editing app to use but only if h use it correctly then u will end up getting the hang of it and u will fully understand how to work it
"I love this app so much! It it is easy to use, fun to edit with, and the perfect app for edits! I recommend this app soo much."
It’s so amazing I love this app and all the features definitely would recommend
can you guys add that effect it would be better for my edits/everyone else’s edits?
"Works amazingly, a few bugs but nothing serious. Plz Keep this app free. Don’t start off free and start sneaking in-app purchases."
Sometimes it will just say insufficient storage so yea- and my storage is clear but whatever thx anyways
They is there that we can to save texts in the element and use them a again and can you add a stagelight effect?
"The Style option was probably the most widely used feature of the app, and the reason why you’d choose this video editor over any other. I cannot recommend an app that actively removes its best features."
Only main problem is that when I download my video it makes the video off sync for no reason
"i love capcut but recently i've been getting this message ""no internet connect try again"" but i have internet."
It was working really great until I actually needed something out of it. It wouldn’t load anything and it was really frustrating.
I had CapCut for the longest time and I still don’t have the easy velocity
"Hi, and I just want to say CapCut is amazing! Popular YouTubers make amazing edits. Personally, I think CapCut is better then video star. There are so many options!"
"I’ve had CapCut for months with over 100 videos and I accidentally deleted the app and poof all the videos that I put hard work into all gone. Thanks a lot CapCut, for deleting over 100 videos that I had spent hours on."
While I was editing oh gacha video The leg kept moving by self I restarted and try to get it to stop it world that is the east but otherwise this app is awesome
Once you start edits they start taking sooo much space. I currently have 9 edits and it takes 8GB of space
"I love the chives and stuff you can do in Capcut but the only thing I dislike about it
Is that it is money for some options"
Am new to this I heard about the app two years ago it’s been working good but please could you add screen recorder into it
It’s free and has barely any lag! I use it very often and it is perfect for editing!
Honestly CapCut is good but when I wanna use audios from TikTok it always says I’m not connected to the internet even when I am-
So I love CapCut but it’s just that I’m trying to use my  favorite TikTok sounds but if stopped  saving so I don’t have any of my interesting sounds. May you fix it? 😂
"I use this app almost every single day, it’s super easy and straightforward and has SUPER cool effects and options and it’s just AMAZING!!"
All I did was open it up and started it didn’t tell me to buy this or that it just let me edit and is sups easy!LUV IT SERIOUSLY!
I really love this editing app but it takes forever for me to update it and it’s been a long time since I was  able to update it so please fix that for all electronics
"Your application is great, but instead of writing, it does not have Persian language.  Please add it"
Thanks!
Every time I try to download it It says start a payment method? I’m just tryna fricken edit please help me what is happening and I used to have it too. So when I download it again it makes me pa for it and it won’t let me download it smh
This app is amazing I love it is very recommended from me because you can do all sort of things!💖
This is the best app for editor i been using it for months now my channel is growing thx to the app!
This app is so great! Very easy to use and super useful for editing quick videos
This is one of the best editing app in the world and I really love it and I think y’all will too
Importing doesn’t work and often takes way too long for a small video.
"Every time I try and edit. There's so many simple glitches that ruin my entire edit that I just spent 30 minutes on. Whenever I try to adjust a clip, it shifts every single clip and ruins the timing with the sound. Its so annoying and makes the whole app unenjoyable."
I love this app but we really need graphs for better and smoother transitions and also storage runs out so quickly not sure why
Stickers were almost unusable for me and ruined an edit I was making
I love it because you can makeVideo pictures your family
This app is amazing its so easy And my edits look so much better then how i did with Kinemaster
I only wish that it had landscape mode for newer iPads.
Umm it a good app idk just my phone or what but it’s super lag you when I’m trying to upload bunch of pictures lags things it lags
"•No in-app purchases
•No watermark
•Extract audio feature
•Canvas blur option
•No annoying ads

This is perfect, when I was using Kinemaster I had like 150 subscribers

But then I changed to CapCut 5 months ago and I’m 140 subscribers away from 1k subscribers, I just don’t know how to thank this app and the developers"
I like CapCut a lot but I just got done editing my video and it’s not letting me upload it so I pressed the x and pressed the x again and then I pressed my video and it says clean up some phone storage and I did fix that problem
10/10
"Every time I preview the video, the splits in the video causes it to lag. This didn’t happen before so I don’t know what’s up."
I got to make one video then I tried to import more clips and it said “Can not import. Error” so I tried to make another video and import clips but it said the same thing
Before I used to have trash editing apps one of my freinds told me about capcut Oh my god this is the best app please consider using this it’s the best app.
"Simply....the best editing app I’ve ever used, and everything is literally free. (What more could you ask for)"
"This app is so useful! I’m a fanpage and I use this for trends,edits,etc. I definitely recommend this for editors,fan pages,and anyone interested!"
I use this app every time and I love it but I hope to add Arabic language and thanks
This app never crashes but if your a Gacha tuber that tweens whouldn’t recommend the app makes the body parts move by it’s self but other then that I am love :)
"It’s okay, but Chroma Key doesn’t work. It’s really confusing and unless you a professional then you probably won’t understand."
kinda hard to understand it at first but amazing after
So when I add music then it makes the vid EVEN LONGER and it’s kinda annoying me. Please fix this problem
I really suggest you download CapCut because it is a fun and easy way to edit photos and videos.
I like the app but i would like if you guys added graphs and keyframes and transitions and etc. the app only has presets and isn’t real editing if you could make those changes.
"Hey, so I’m trying to do a edit but when I try to shorten a picture or do anything, it kicks me out of the app.. what should I do? Other than that, lovely game"
I used this app for awhile and it worked fine but now if I add over 8 photos or just 4 it slows down and freezes so I can’t see what my edit looks like I used to love your app but it’s not working at all anymore
I need green screen for a important thing plz add it
When I try making my video the app tells me I need to up date it and it is update already it’s quite annoying
Omg I love cap cut. It’s amazing better that any other editor I’ve ever used. It’s so easy and I recommend it for beginners. Download it!
I downloaded CapCut about a month ago and I am ALREADY making awesome edits! It’s simple and easy to use. 10/10!
Best app I’ve used I’ve used so may apps but they all leave watermarks and you need to pay for transitions this app is amazing DOWNLOAD IT
"First of all this is a really good app. but once I start on doing edits, it just becomes very very laggy.I don’t know what to do it’s just very laggy I need help."
"Awesome features and options.  But buggy, app crashes in the middle of editing and I can’t get past 6:30 mins into my video that I’m editing.  Help!"
"I am so happy with this app! Eee! I cried because I knew it would change a lot! This has so many aesthetic, pop cool stuff that all you tubers use to edit! I ADORE THIS!"
My friend introduced me 剪映。  So easy to use.  Love it.  One thing I feel strongly to use it is the PINYIN font.  It helps me to connect more people. I found us version 剪映， viamaker.  I’m disappointed the PINYIN font is missing for viamaker.  Many of my friends feel the same way.  I hope it will be available soon.
Why can’t I pick out more pictures I always have to refresh my phone…
This is an amazing app ive been using it for two years now and i absolutely love it
I love this app it’s great for editing but when I use the camera I can’t flip it to the front so I can’t see the effect so I don’t know If I am in the frame but overall great app
"I really love Capcut it’s that I’ve seen the velocity edit thing and I don’t have it I updated it and nothing is there please help
Me out if you can .paola"
Love the app but for some reason I can’t get a auto velocity and I don’t know why I don’t have it. If anyone knows can you guys help me?
"It’s a very good editing app, just it takes up a lot of data storage"
"I'm sorry, but the new updates are the worst, I have a great working phone so ik it not my phone but every video I make it's so laggy! And when i try to remove the background it gets rid of the whole image. Fix this capcut."
So right now I was editing and video for my friend Alyssa and I added one of the stock videos and I added some effects and it didn’t show up so I did it another time and the same thing happened again it was just a waste of my time 🙄
The screen goes black after a certain period of time in a video
It’s fine until I try to use graphs then the tutorial message won’t go away
If you us graphs your zoom will like cancel itself out 😭
Cap-cut is a really good app with good ratings and free so i decided to use it. Well sometimes when i try to do an overlay it will not let me do a video overlay or a picture overlay.
The app is amazing and I love it and I edit with it a lot but we need motion blur to make them smoother so please? Can you add that?
Can you make it that you dont need storage to make videos? If yes plsss i need it ima make an edit thats why.
I love this app I’ve always loved everyone’s edits so I wanted to and I’m 8 (and a half) so it was hard but I saw CapCut and I love editing
CapCut is amazing but pls add so when you sLow it down it’s smooth. But I love CapCut and I use it for all my edits!
"I’m so sorry for the 1 star but when I’m doing a edit and I make it bigger it goes faster and I hate it! And when I don’t want the edit to be it and i redo it the photo section says Take pictures BUT I DID!
I love the app though  but those are the problems I can’t work with"
"Honestly this is better than KineMaster because I cand do gacha memes, and do edits! Definitely recommend 10/10!"
"Capcut is amazing with its overlays, and presets. One suggestion is adding graphs. Sure graphs isnt for newbies that just started editing, but it would make such a BIG difference."
It is the best editing app that I think can do anything for free thanks capcut plz never update the free version it is good
Hey capcut you need to work ONk getting graphs and good turns like video star and maybe you can do more than AE and Vsp work on the slow turns
"I love this app, but I would really like if it would let me edit without telling me that I have insufficient storage left. My iPhone can tell me that itself."
This game is cool I like and I just download it it was very cool 😎 and it helps me a lot but I wish it had music 🎵 so good I like it and I won’t stop using it!
"I love the app it’s a great editing app It has a lot of effects and there’s a lot . I use it to put videos together mostly and the only problem is THIS APP WONT LEAVE MY DANM STORAGE ALONE 
I DELETED ALL MY GAMES JUST FOR THOS APPP AND MY PHOTOS BUT NOOOOOOOOO  IT STILL SAYS MY STORAGE IS FULL😤 overall it’s a good app  🥲 lol😶‍🌫️"
"i really like the app, and how it’s nothing like video star. it’s really simple, and you have made it easy to edit your dream videos. the only thing that i would recommend is adding more effects because the few that we have are starting to get old. overall i give capcut 4 stars for overall design, and simplicity."
"I mean the app is good but, I hate how we can’t crop the videos how we want to, like we can only zoom in and out which is dumb, but it’s decent app tbh"
"Its good but everytime when i use it and make an edit for my friend, it says i need to clean my storage. I don’t wanna delete the app but i’m gonna get another editing app cause this one i hate it."
"I honestly love this app so much! But, i’d love some smooth transitions and some like you would get on video star or ae."
i LOVE this app but there is one thing that bothers me so much. the overlay tool. it doesn’t work for me. when i click overlay on a maintrack clip to make it into an overlay clip it doesn’t work. i don’t know if it’s just on me or??
I love the app it’s really great but everytime I click the copy button a few times I’m getting a lot of lag and it’s really bad
"I LOVE THIS APP 100% I love how you can choose whether to have the watermark or not
I can make good edits, I have a fanpage of charli and it is really great app! Nothing wrong with it🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼"
"Oh. My. Gosh. I LOVE THISSSS!!!! One of my favorite Gachatubers use this app, and I got the hang of it in LESS THAN TEN MINUTES!! I recommend this app if you dont know what kind of editing apps to use."
I think it’s good and also no water mark it’s just that I can’t move anything
"cap cut is an AMAZING app, it can do wonders. but my bling won't work, it says i'm not connected to the internet??? i am, i've been refreshing it, yet it stays the same. I really need help🚨🚨"
The app is 100% great I LOVE it but I wish you can download fonts from the internet
I just wanna say THIS APP IS MY LIFE!I use it along with video star for my gacha vids it helps so much thank you for creating such a great editing app pls see this 5 starts totally ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
"This app is so freaking goo but I wish you could make your own key frames and stuff but it’s good anyways, with no watermark and it’s free so like cool"
I’ve had this app for two day now and I have made a thousand edits I just can’t believe how amazing this app isssss get this app NOW
"the problem is that i am trying to make an edit but for some reason i don’t see the style section to make the edit. like i updated capcut but it didn’t work i don’t know if its in the effects but i checked and didn’t see it.
so if you could please add the style section back i would love it"
Could y’all add masking tool where you cut out something from the video? It would be awesome
"I love this app, it’s really amazing and easy to use for edits, but the only problem is that my animations aren’t working for some reason:(( hopefully this is fixed soon!"
This is the best editing app on iPhone and mobile devices ever used better that iMovie it’s almost like your editing on pc
Hands down the best video editing app out there!
"The last update removed most of the picture styles, including the 3D Zoom effect.  Why would the publisher remove these features?"
LOVE the app!! It’s an easy editing app to use and you don’t have to buy anything completely free it’s just that you keep taking anyway thing like auto velocity and it’s not cool
I love the app but the velocity hasn’t been working I’ve always updated it and never got the velocity yet.
Every other day Style keeps disappearing and I checked and I already updated the app and it’s quite frustrating
"It’s really good for my videos, it’s just it takes too much space to creat one. I think they should 100% fix that."
Well about this it’s such a good app for gacha videos I love this app but can you cut out stuff in this app I really need to know ty!
"Every time I try to make a video it says I have no pictures to do it with ,and I know I do. It just frustrase me."
I’ve been using CapCut for a while. My phone is not set up so I don’t have enough storage so I offloaded the app. I’m trying to open a video I made and it keeps kicking me out. It kicks me out of the whole app. And I’m getting annoyed.
It has all I need and many more. Thank you developers for beeping it tree. It's the best video app ever
Hey I love this but I don’t have the new effects I even updated the app so can you please help?
I don’t have the velocity thing on style I updated it but it’s still not there☹️
This app is one of my favorite apps on my hole phone it’s amazing trust me
I need it for new voice for the characters I’m doing for a mia’s movie thingy
I love CapCut but I never got the new edits like the velocity and when I try to use the other ones they don’t work and I don’t know why?? Someone help me please and that’s good
I like CapCut and all but they got rid of velocity and now it’s hard to make edits
This is one of my favorite editing apps and it’s AMAZING totally should get it NO ADDS INCLUDED and it makes me very happy to use it
This app is really good and frustrating at the same time and maybe you should add more layers
I dont really know how to edit but this makes editing easy
Okay so it is the best! I love the stickers and I love how u can add cool effects!!!!! So it should get 5 star! You can also add translations LIKE WHOA!!!!
"So im just doing a simple edit, but when i add a sound from tiktok, it says no internet connection or something like that. Please help me"
Amazing app no complaints at All. it’s a perfect app for my videos never had a complaint. THANK you.
I wish you could search up a sound you want
I use this for my gacha life/club videos and when I try using the “move over time” button it always forgets where I’m trying to move it
"I had looked for an editing app that was good but they had very bad tools and then I found CapCut and it had the best tools ever. REALLY GOOD APP!
😎👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍"
"I’ve been using this app for so long now, I’m in love with this app. I will give this a 5/5 star rating because this app is amazing!!"
I love you so much. Please don’t ever change and continue to be accessible to everyone. 💞
"Actually I love this app so much, cause it’s easy to use & free, But I wish this app supports Arabic language. 

Keep going & think about my opinion please."
i cannot do my edits smoothly . I can’t use the videos i want to use to make a good edit . please fix this capcut
This is a good app. I would recommend it because im a gacha creator in training and its so easy to edit all my vides!
This app is really cool and all but one thing that doesn’t work is the graphs it doesn’t let me use graphs AT ALL I tried everything but nothing is working like I can’t touch it
"I love this app very much it is free and easy to use on any mobile device, but it wold be very great if they can make a pc version. Then I would really love. So I ope they do that! Bye!"
"Hi creators of CapCut!
This is such an awesome video maker. I can do anything and there is so many options. You guys did an awesome job. Ahhh. I’m in CapCut heaven. 😆😁

-Your fan"
Takes to much storage! I delete 500 photos and I have to keep deleting the app and getting it back pleas fix this cuz when I want to make a video it tells me I don’t have enough store after I deleted 500 photos!
"The only thing I hate about it is that in certain times it’ll say insufficient storage,so I can’t make a video"
If y’all don’t understand I use this app for editing seggcy men like the kfc guy with abs and his shirt off idk what u thinkin 🪑🪑🪑🪑😟
"I love this so much! I can make many things with it but it keeps on telling me to delete things, while I come up with like 6 edits, so maybe, PLEASE make the storage have more spaceeee?"
"i love this app. it’s so much fun and super easy. and has really good options for an app that’s completely free. my only problem is that after i exit out of the app, and go back in i can’t go to my profile or go to the templates or anything, it disappears and idk how to get it back. if anyone could help that would be great. other than that the app is awesome"
I just wanted to say how I love this app so much! It is so easy to use and there is NO WATERMARK! It has nice transitions for edits and everything:) 5/5 recommend it!
Can you add smooth slow mo like on VSCO I don’t feel like paying for it-
I worked on an edit for HOURS. Then lost it all just because I accidentally clicked the wrong edit to deleted. There was no recover thing in the app. I’ve contacted the people to see if I can get it back and they haven’t replied. Utterly disappointed and upset.
This app is really cool! You can edit on this Even with no green screen! I recommend getting it 100% :)
"Hello so I have been use this app and it amazing but 
Can you add import fonts pls but everything else is amazing and yea"
"Best editing app ever created video star is nothing in comparison this is so simple and easy, Keep Up The Good Work!"
"In the chroma key it won’t let me use intensity why is that?
Btw I LOVE the app I just want it to let me use the things:)"
This is a good app but it says storage full when it isn’t and I get get to the videos I worked hard on so think u should work on that
I honestly love this app I feel like it could be easier but it’s great for all of my edits!! I would give a 4/5!!!
YES I love CapCut but they should have a feature where you can put more than one animation on a clip rather than just one.
CapCut is the best editing app I’ve used. It doesn’t crash or lag. And it lets me cut clips way shorter
At the beginning this was great but now that I have been using it more CapCut doesn’t provide what I need. I suggest that you select another editing software because this one is only good for intros and texts.
"I LOVE THIS APP! It’s perfect to edit videos for tiktok 😆. I can add my own audio. But, I just wish we can have an option to make a folder 📁. Other than that, this app is GREAT 😊👍🏻."
"This is hands down one of the greatest apps in the App Store. No debate, but there are bugs that needs to be fix. 

I have the new IOS 14.1 update and now many of the effects are not loading. I can’t apply it to the video.

It keeps saying no internet, can’t connect. 

It’s frustrating.

Please fix. 

Everything else is magnificent."
I love this app thank you so much please do not change thank you sm
This is a amazing editing app! I recommend it it’s so easy to edit and gREAT working layers and text! I love it! Keep the work going developers! <3
This is a really great app! It’s good for editing and other things. I use it a lot and it’s the best editing app I’ve used.
"The best editing app ever! I wish they had an option for a computer, but it’s amazing."
"I have one complaint. When I try to rearrange the photos, they just go to the end. If you ever fix this, I would be happy to give it 5 stars."
"Honestly putting more animations for texts would be really helpful, im not that great at making my own loll"
"I see the update about templates, but I don’t see any templates anywhere. Do you know why?"
The app is really good but I really want that they add gif because is better to and I use a lot of gif🥺🙏🏻
This app is amazing and FREE!!! But I also wish we could make an account just in case for our videos to be more secure.
I love this app. I have had it for like 4 days and I am already obsessed!!!!!!❤️❤️ wish I found this app sooner
So i was bored and downloaded capcut for tiktoks and all that but it wont for the life of me connect to the wifi please fix
"Best editing app on the App Store hands down and the best part is it’s all free no in app purchases, no memberships totally free it’s really rare to find apps like this nowadays."
Seriously one of the best video/photo editor I’ve ever used. Super simple and easy. AND no watermarks. AND no ads whatsoever. Thank you so much for making this ❤️
Capcut is a great editing app but when I pressed stickers it says no internet but everything else is great
I was trying to make an edit but then it would not let me use any photos saying I don’t have any
"When I choose 60 fps and upload it, it doesn’t let me, it lower the fps, please fix this."
"So ive been editing on this app for months and i think imma move to alight motion. Because of how i can use the style effect, I've haven't edited in a while. Then i came back to capcut to not see the style button. So you piece of craps fix this b4 I switch to alight motion."
This app is pretty cool and I use it a lot. The problem is that the app by itself takes up a lot of storage and I don’t have enough storage already.
I updated the app but I can’t get the new effect I have seen people have it and I really want it but I looked and it’s nowhere
So every time I try making a edit or whatever it tells me to go to settings and allow to save videos to camera. Every time I go to settings I see nothing so I go back and it keeps telling me the same thing! I’m very dissatisfied CapCut
sometimes when you need to press play it’ll stop and won’t play the video or when you got a lot of effects it’ll freeze. i really loved the app but this is getting ridiculous.
Hey I was a beginner editor when I came across this app I absolutely love it and completely mastered it all I want to ask is if you can add exposure?
"I’m trying to edit for tik tok, and even though I have favorite sounds, they are not showing up on this app and it is VERY annoying!!! I can’t ever use the app because of it so I don’t even know if it is a good editing app or not, but the tik tok sound thing sealed the deal for me."
I really like this but if you added a green screen that would be great.
My sister has this app and I use it all the time. I decided to get it and I love it
When I made a 7 minute clip  and saved it to my phone some how the clip reversed and I sped hours on it man 💀
It is ok but one thing one app in the App Store is the same thing also when you go up to 40 edits well for me it won’t let be edit or download any thing .
"Definitely the best editing app ever 👏👏 
Keep going. Add more video effects … 
Thank you for this."
Recommend this very much
I’ve been using cap cut fo a while and it’s pretty easy to use I made all my edits on it follow my tik tok lovely_princess02 to see them
First off it’s not letting me download it’s like making me stop
Capcut is my favorite editing app i love everything about it except that even when i have wifi its says not able to connect on only tiktok audios
This app is awful it’s disgusting and irritating I hate you and you can’t even dance
It has been helping my TikTok edits soooo much pls everyone install this amazing app also to the creator of this: TYSM for making this app.
This is the best app I swear please keep this app up forever CapCut please this app is better then some computer editing software best app ever
It kept on glitching and when I went out of my edit the edit will disappear
"It provides nice, quality tools, but the entire app is a buggy mess along with the tedious controls and trying to find everything there, just go buy a computer and get adobe instead of this unorganized and alot of unnecessary tools too."
"I have this app ad I did a edit and it will let me save the video to my camera roll, but I have enough space"
I love this app but yesterday whenever I tried to import a picture it said I couldn’t can you fix it?
"CapCut is the best editing app hands-down but they need to add a 4:5 format which is for Instagram portraits. Other than that, great app 10/10."
"So I loved Capcut, I made tons of funny videos on there, I didn’t export them yet! Because I thought cap cut would keep my videos safe and guess what!! I went on today AND IT WAS ALL GONE, if you could some how get my stuff back I would love that!"
PLEASE FIX THIS  whe you delete photos or. Videos you lose that in the app so I have trouble with my storage because if this
This app is amazing to use!! But I would love for you to add motion blur and graphs and stuff like that please!!!
Ok I use to make bad videos but now I have this app I could have done anything with out this apppppppp THANK YOU CAPCUT!
"It seems that with the update, this has become dysfunctional. I’m not able to add any videos because of “no internet connection” even when I have 5 bars and full wifi... it’s ridiculous. Will be moving to a competitor."
Catcup is the best app for me because I help me learn how to edit in an easy way plus they don’t charge you
I live this WAY better then KineMaster there is no PaY tHiS fOr BeTtEr StUfF it is better and easy who doesn’t ❤️ this..?  NO ADS IS EVEN BETTER I HAVE GLOSSY ROBLOX EDITS
So when I was in about to make an edit and delete all my edit like wow so I don’t know if I’ll ever make edits on CapCut maybe but yeah be careful because I cut my delete or edit and stuff I just got really mad
So I worked 2 days on this vlog and I had exit out of the project. And once I did it wouldn’t let me open it back up and said I had a corrupted file.
"knowing that most photo apps charge for such big effects, this one has no “pro” and it’s great! no watermarks :P"
When will the style effect be on IPhone?
CapCut if you add graphs your app will start to increase more than more before and it will improve the app by a lot
"It so cool, it’s so much filters and I love all the stuff you can do on there! This is the best editing app! 🥰"
I love this app. It’s like KineMaster but with no annoying watermark and more amazing effects. Please rate 5 stars when rating this app.
This is a very good app but everytime I use it I have to delete it and get it back because it wont let me use pictures only videos!
"My youger sibling did a voiceover, and i cant delete it! When I press on the voiceover, it takes me to the musics audio. Pls fix this in the future."
"From what my friend has been editing off of capcut, I think it’s a really good app! 🙃"
"All my work, and everything, gone. It had all the access it needed. I had no choice but to delete the app, part was saying it needed access to something it already had access to. It made me cry because I had so much work on there. :("
i absolutely love this app and i always use it. but i was making a vlog and was almost done with it but i accidentally deleted the whole thing. it is my fault for deleting the vlog but it would be great if they had a recently deleted option so you can go back to ur edits just in case you deleted them:(. other than that it’s a good app<3
it’s good but I suggest if they made more transactions that slide left and right like how the pro ones are
Can u make the text thing have animations like go ones please
I love this app so much! But it would be nice to have more animations and filters like in pro editing
Can you add some edgy shakes. I really enjoy the app but I wish it had a way bigger variety
I love this app although I wish we can make our own transition
"This is literally a LIFE CHANGERRR, I absolutely love this app, it’s 100% free, and you can edit sooo good!! It’s amazing!!! Totally recommend!!!!!!!!  🤩😍😁"
I really love this app of the way it edits and it makes it easy but I don’t really like the new update cause you cant use different animations now and it’s really hard to work with.
The app works great but sometimes it acts dumb. It starts to lag and completely messes up your edit.
So at first i loved until I noticed how the transitions were it took a while to get to the next photo they should update that and they don’t have a lot of stickers or no search for the stickers thanks please see this
Good app but the bling effects never work and I have no idea why when I press on them they say no connection or something but every other effect works
"Look I love Capcut but today they removed STYLE, style helped me with a lot of my edit and maybe it was on accident but I’m so sad it’s not there, please Capcut add it back"
"It’s so good it’s like video star without doing a lot of work this app is better than video star 
P.s add more free transitions please😁"
This is a wonderful app please don’t every change it because it’s a great app and I’m in love with it 😊❤️
"It’s great app and I’ve been using it a lot and I will give it five stars again if they fix this, I imported a 1080p video and when it gets in there it’s like 127p it’s not doing this with any other editing software."
Why did y’all take the effect that replays and replays slowly 😭😭I can’t do good edits anymore
The style option to edit videos disappeared out of nowhere and that’s pretty much most of what I use the app for. I tried updating but still it doesn’t work.
I can’t tween with my ocs and with ur auto velocity thing never appeared in style or anything but on TikTok everyone else did please fix this :<
You can tweak your videos to your preference. I like it and very easy to use!
It’s the best editor I love the text to speech and effects it’s amazing and maybe you should add recording option BUT THIS APP IS AMAZING KEEP IT UP!
I’m so impressed how you guys added so many effects. Capcut is an AMAZING free beginners app. I love it. Use it 24/7
I love capcut cause it has the best quality for me my opinion nice effects I cant type all day but that’s all is really good!
It was good at first and then when I went to make my 3rd edit my personal sounds weren’t there for some reason.
It’s good but I won’t let me put overlays.. but it’s good you could post it on tiktok you could do like edits and stuff!
"So I wanna use it but there’s something wrong with the velocity style. I have been updating it and it doesn’t show or work,"
Okay so one day I decided to download and use Capcut so I did it is really easy to use! I suggest you download it.
It's so simple to use and it so easy than the others
"It’s literally 8.52GB and i have absolutely no projects saved on my device, I’ve made about 10 but deleted them, have absolutely no idea why it’s so taxing on the storage, please fix because I can’t use this app if it fills up 10% of my storage and I have no videos saved"
All of a sudden you cannot add TikTok music to a video. What happened? Says cannot connect to internet. Nothing wrong with my internet. Please fix.
"I’m trying to do velocity but whenever I cut the video and try to bake it 100x it goes down to 10x. I’m finally motivated for editing but this just ruins the whole thing,"
I just started editing A couple months ago with capcut and I love it! It is so easy to edit with CapCut!
Can you make it so we can make reaction videos?
I love how this app works but there some difficult times in this app I would not recommend this app but you guys have the right to choose what to play
This is the best app I have used for editing and the one that I like the most
I love CapCut an use it allll the time but it tends to lag randomly and I don’t know how to fix it it’s a very laggy app of you use it for too long it needs a fix
It’s a great video maker just every single time I delete a bigger video than the one I’m making it says that my storage is still to much.
I tried to do that flash thing it does not give a tutorial and it’s to complicating I am just trying to do the venom and roit and carenge I would not download this app terrible maybe update it to make it less frustrating and annoying
"I love this editing app for Gacha TikToks but now every time I try to import a video or picture it crashes, can u pls fix that?"
Capcut is a very fun thing to edit! You can do shade in and stuff i really like it! Anytime when i try to edit something it says i have full storage but yeah !
Please add graphs. The camera movement is stiff other than that it’s been great
"For some reason it says I need to give it access to the album to make a new project, but it keeps not working and in settings capcut doesn’t even show up at all. Please fix."
I have just started using CapCut and already like it. It’s so simple to use and has great features.
"Great editing app but when I add sound to it, I can’t add anymore photos, only videos. Kinda frustrating tbh"
Capcut is a great app!but everytime i wanna edit it says my storage is full and I delete alot of stuffs but its still not helping!hope u fix this problem! :)
I love using CapCut it’s my favorite editing app and it makes it so easy and comes in good quality but if they added motion blur it would be amazing
Hey I just wanted to say this app is great I saw somebody on TikTok that was a paid editor so I will grow and dream until I accomplish my goal.!
"This needs alot of changes 1. The head keeps growing off the charcter every time i try to tween
2. It keeps moving off
CHANGE IT im getting annoyed by it thanks for reading also i love this app but it’s annoying sometimes"
Some people say it’s bad but it’s not they just don’t know how to use watch tutorials on TikTok it helps!
I make TikToks for fun and I use this app for Gacha life ones. And this helps me SO much with gaining followers I went from 38 to 42 under a day thanks to this app!
Whenever I try to make the thing short it keeps pressing the transition button and it’s just annoying but I know that don’t read these so yeah but it’s just plain annoying
I love this but every single time I try to edit like pictures really fast it glichtes and I HATE that it gives me so my stress and I couldn’t even make my edit. Please fix this
Don’t Get me wrong THIS APP IS REAL GOOD! But I wish it had more effects On the Animation! So CapCut Please do this I love your app I was recommended Too it I am a editor For nba and NFL
"This is the best editing app EVER! No watermark, no worries about any subscription. Literally everything is free! I love this app. This app has to be the best so far."
"This app is amazing to edit your videos.
But the bad part is that when you’re storage is full you can’t edit"
"The app is good for edits, I use it for making tiktok edits and I love how they some out so I would recommend getting it. 😃👍"
Who ever made this thank you i can edit videos now😁
I love this app because I make edits and this makes them so much easier !!
"For Some Reason When I Export My Video It Only Shows 1080p,I Thought There Was 2K/4K Quality.I Asked My Brother And He Has A IPhone 7 And I Have A 8,Maybe It’s Not My Phone But Please Respond🖤🤍"
This is the best free editing app ever all the effects are so cool and how you can put music in them it is awesome
It’s the best and it’s really simple to i love that it doesn’t make your video ugly with a water mark and the trasitions are grate
Okay so Don’t get me wrong I have used this app and loved it! But the fact I know I have room on my phone and your telling me I don’t really upsets me I wouldn’t get this app if your low on storage
"Overall, the app is amazing! But the thing is the effects don’t work."
Best free editing app hands down. Just need that hdr support and you guys win the internet lol
"This app is SO laggy, and it doesn’t let you make short photos with transitions and it doesn’t let you tap on certain things because of the lag and overall it’s a horrible app 2/10 I wouldn’t recommend, I would prefer funimate any day over this."
Hi I love this app so much it made me famous but every since you took out style from CapCut I’m so sad now please bring style back!!:(
Ok 👍 I’m not going back there now I just got home from work so I’m just got a little tired I
"the app in itself is outstanding. however, you should be able to add gifs via the overlay option. wait, i’ll rephrase that. the gifs should move instead of staying still. overall, this app is great. i love all of the animations and everything. that’s all, really."
This editing app is the BEST it’s so easy to use and so fast and simple would 10/10 recommend!
I love this app it has really good things but I want there to be more transitions and more animations pls add more thank you
Such an amazing app. Very easy editing with lots of options and completely free with no ads???
How do we share the video and post it on Instagram?
Really easy to use. Overall 10/10 I would recommend it to any editors out there 💕
Capcut can do pretty much anything! my best edits were made by Capcut! you should definitely get it
Where did style go!?!?! Im trying to edit but I can’t find style??
I love love this app I really like making videos soooo much fun! It’s also easy to use. Really like UwU
I just need to do a really quick edit but I can’t bc there’s no auto velocity out of all times omg
"Thanks for your attention 
I have some problems with style options 
It doesn’t show in app
What can i do???"
Can you please add the slight motion thing when there is shapes and borders is there is then please do a search bc I can’t find it
I love capcut but y’all removed the style button and that’s what I used for my editssss
"I love this app so much, you should download it I got a lot of like on my TikTok for using this app I love it so much"
"When I opened it to edit my video, I was trying to put an effect but it was saying there’s no internet even though there was. I re-opened it several times it didn’t work, please fix this weird bug 🙏🏻"
CapCut is very easy to use and I 100% recommend it! and I would pay 100 for premium CapCut
"I loves the app very much, but when I use over 5 keyframes, It'll bug out and freeze, but everything else is amazing!"
There was hate. I supported cap cut now the haters are loving CapCut:(. But still it’s very good! Recommend getting it! ♡
I’ve had some issues with the app saying I have no storage when I have 2 TBs left and not letting me create or save videos I make.
Its good but i didn’t get the auto velocity update i would like if u fix it for me
so my friend has this app and I Was going to try it but when I tried downloading it it wouldn’t let me I don’t know why but I hope I can download it soon
So all my friends were using this so I got it I like how it is but my mane problem is that it’s a ton of gb so I can’t download anything.
Yes the app is really good I like it but sometimes it can be hard like I have issues with it that’s all ❤️‍🔥
"I literally love this. I was upset at first that I couldn’t buy the twenty dollar fancy apps but I just needed practice. CAPCUT ADDED SMOOTH SLOMO, AND NOW ITS LIKE ANY OTHER APP! It’s SOOOOO GOOD, I can’t get over it. Thanks capcut"
"I love the capcut application, but I wish to add the Arabic language to the application so that we can write in the Arabic language. Greetings to you."
when i try to make the head moves The body always Disappear that's so annoying -
After a while it starts to glitch and lag out to where you can’t see how the video is doing and you need to fix it.
"I LOVE this app when your a beginner and don’t know how to edit well my guy this will help you 

Love,
        Idk"
So a wile ago I used to adore this app but then now I have to continuously uninstall the app to let me edit my videos and it takes so long just to let me do my job so I don’t think I will use this app for a wile….
I love this app because my whole family uses it so we’re like all editors now lol 😂
It won’t give me access and it’s asking me to allow access to my album but I can’t access that.
It works fine and has good results. All I request is  that you give us a search button for the noises. Ty 😘
this is the best editing app ever I love it it’s so easy to use thank you for making this app thank you so much 😊
CapCut got me started with editing and I till you it sometimes CapCut was how I started and I will to remember that
"Can you guys add motion blur it will make the edits more smoother and appear much nicer, CapCut is a really good app but motion blur would make it better for free edits"
I was trying to put a photo lined up with the music but it keeps moving away it’s really annoying.
It’s really good but sometimes it lags- But is really nice (Sorry if it’s short-)
"your app is incredible!! by far the best yet! my only complaint is please try to improve your chroma key!! also, as vast as your selection is, more transitions/animations never hurt anybody!! love your app and will continue to use is for as long as i can imagine, keep doing great things! -velocity editor"
Hi my name is Bella I love this app because you can edit very cool stuff you can go try it for ur see and see how fun it is.
I love this app but it uses so much of my storge I can’t make a single video don’t get me wrong I love this app but it uses all of my storge
5 Star
"It is very good for me and editing, but i think there should be a custom animation feature."
I was making a stranger things edit and it won’t let me go on the edit  omg it never has done this. Before it is a good edit place but like give me my edit back
I love this app a lot and it has helped me make amazing vids and all but in my opinion this app is to worried about my storage.
I like capcut but the thing is l have to clean Storage and l do that almost everyday but it still doesn’t work for some reason
It is a good eroding app but it keeps telling me that I have no storage but I do I have deleted most of my photos and videos I don’t understand
It’s literally the same as the paid editing apps but free 10/10
I use this app to edit my Roblox tiktok videos. It’s SUPER easy to use. I 200% recommend!!.
I love CapCut it’s a great app to do edits but I feel like it needs some updates to add features beacuse it’s great and free but other apps have so many more cool things that you can’t to on CapCut
There really is no future that you are missing. Everything is in there. And most of all is FREE!
I love this this app so much because it was easy to use not thst hard and my channel axxyira went up 20 subs I am so happy :)
I think this app is pretty good with all the stuff you can do. It isn’t as complicated as the other editing apps.
Why will it consume cellular data if I wanna look at one or edit one again
Whenever I try to make a video it says insufficient storage and I can’t even view my things can you guys add more storage to the app itself or like the app can’t handle that much storage? 💀 or what?
Capcut is the BEST editing app I’ve used but every time I have to delete all my photos to edit another video because it always fills up so quick
It’s a good app and I like it. I think the app could use more transitions and animations. But one thing a really want is custom text.
"I love it it’s my favorite app but does not support Arabic language
Especially type the writing appears reversed"
"I love this app I make great edits with it and it’s FREE. I always wanted to make cool edits but i have to have premium in other apps, but this app is FREE which is amazing thank u!"
I loved this app until I saw the new update. It really bummed me that everything got so complicated and I can’t even add photos anymore.
"Hi! This is app is a great app! I think you guys should add some motion effects and more and more other effects, stickers etc. also some filters to!"
"I mean is very good for everbody but I think they should add people, put a lot of overlays and a curves for keyframes"
i love this app it is great for editing my videos and finishing some of them up but since the added halloween edits my app just says “no internet connection” but i have internet as i am able to do things that you can’t do without the internet i would appreciate if you fixed this but it’s a great app overall
When I am editing and I go to the animate thing and press zoom it says there’s no internet but there is so bad
"sometimes the app lags or kicks me out but other than it it’s great, 😺😺more options for the in/out transitions would be nice too the chroma key doesn’t really work as well, like there some parts that don’t rlly work?? but overall he app is rlly good it only needs small improvements but yeah😸👍"
"What’s cool about this app is you get great quality edits for free.

You have the choice to put the watermark in the video or not. 

This app also includes very professional transitions that are pre-made for you, making it easy to put together something.

It’s much more simple and affordable to use. :)"
Did you guys get rid of the velocity feature? It was one of my favorites and now it’s not anywhere.
Okay this app is good but everytime like EVERY TIME i go try to download a new tiktok song that i like it wont work and i tried to delete it and download back it couldn't let me have access  to my tiktok account!
Love this app amazing but has issues need some tissues 🤧.
This took the words right out of my mouth!
I use this app every day as a content creator and social media manager
CapCut is sooo fun and easy to use I highly recommend this app for anyone who is interested in editing.
It’s ok I love it but the only thing is that every time I start the vid it starts glitching every time even when I close the app
Ok so this is great… but the thing is.. they keep asking me to delete photos and games but i deleted all of my games and the photos i have i use and every single time!! THEY ASK ME TO DELETE MORE AFTER I DELETED LIKE 100 SO 3 STARS…🤨
"Since the last update, sound in app is out of sync"
"This app is fine. But as an editor you cant just use pre-made transitions, that isn’t editing. If you want to just add effects to your videos, fine thats great. But don’t say you use capcut for editing."
Cap cut is amazing the amounts of how much I do in there I have bin using it ever since the early 2020 and is amazing
"It is AMAZING 🤩 love it, the only thing that it needs more options , only that"
iMovie is an exclusive to iPhones/Macs so I expected a lot from it but no capcut is way better. It’s free too
This is a good app but whenever I want to select a photo overlay today and I have a bunch of photos i want to add it says I have none and I’m really mad at it PLEASE fix that please capcut
Great app for video editing but can you please add arabic language support
"This is a good editing app but can you pwease make it less phone storage to export a video, picture, etc."
I'm a young YouTuber who wanted to learn how to edit and had no idea so I searched up editing apps and found this BEST Beginner editing app ever!!!
So when I was making an animation it kept on going the other way and kept on glitching every time so I gave CapCut a two out of five and I hope they do fix the glitch.
I use this all the time to edit and it so fun
I use this app to edit my videos and it’s amazing! Definitely recommend! 😊
All I’m sayin is CapCut if u see this add more neon text things like there only two pls add more text presets that are neon
"I like it, but, I have a great internet connection and it still says no internet connection, enabling me to not do a lot. Great app, but please fix it"
I liked it but then it stoped working and messed up my phone now I can’t download it or anything I cant delete Photos I don’t want I’ll just keep reappearing i don’t know if this is because of capcut but plz be cautious.
So I’m just trying to make a gacha video and I can’t because cap cut not loading it idk if it’s happening for anyone else but cap cut start working also when you delete the app it erases everything
I gave it a 1 because it says I don’t have storage when I only have like 5 photos and I’m trying to edit my video fix ur problem please and ty..
If I could rate this a one star I would mostly because it lags like crazy and when ever I make a video it doesn’t want me to be great and the volume starts skipping and it doesn’t even play it all the way through
Currently needs a patch. I’m implementing clips from my camera roll yet it’s putting in the wrong clips.
"I never write a review however, this app deserve 5 stars. Easy to use and powerful."
CapCut can y’all please add graphs if y’all do everyone will use this app because everyone knows about so please add graphs
Five start rating Definitely recommend
So much better than splice. Everything I need is free unlike splice here’s your 5 star.
I use cap cut for my roblox TikTok and this helps me edit my videos 100% free and I this you should use this app
Is there a reason why style isn’t able to be clicked? I updated it and all I basically have an ‘IPhone 9’ is it my phone?
"dont get me wrong this app is great no watermark no nothing but one thing is that When i use over 20 Photo’s it lags out like lag as in the Screen frozes but the audio and stuff keeps going.

i hope you can fix this but this is a really good app dont get me wrong"
"It is so fun! It is really easy to use, and I learn how to use it really fast. Now I can’t stop using it!!"
Can you put the anime button back pls
I love a lot but it lags so When I save the video the timing  is incorrect. So please fix it but overall it is very easy to use.
This is super easy to use!
I love this app but... for some reason it keeps crashing :/ I think there is some issues with the app. Good app tho :)
I love this app but some reason it’s not letting me open overlay it can open everything else other than overlay.
This is so underrated you should get it if you want a simple way to edit
Hey CapCut! Your app is cool but I would like if your phone storage wasn’t there. I deleted old things off my phone and your app still says I need to clean up. Please fix that because it got on my nerves. Thank you and Hapoy Valentines Day!
"This app is not good for me becouse when i want to watch my videos, there is a text: you have not got high storage, please clean up your device! And i am so angry!😡😡Then this app is good but also trush!"
"Yes, this app is BOMB! And I say BOMB! I love the editing, very fancy text style options, and so many tools! I would say this is my FAVORITE editing app! Thank you!! 💝"
"It's so good app for make movie, story and etc
I really like this 😍
Please add Persian (farsi) or Arabic text support. (Type and import font)"
When i try to do a video the sounds i use won’t go in the video i tried cut the video or refresh the page it doesn’t work 👁👄👁
CapCut is a Great app I use it fo editing mixtapes the only problem I’m running into is it says my storage is full when I have 50GB left in my storage
It was awesome other than that it would glitch during my transitions but I ignored that and when I was done it looked amazing !!!
So I was editing some stuff and wanted to add the bling effect but it said “unable to connect “ so I was confused becouse I was connected to internet but other that it’s a pretty good app
This app is amazing. It always you to edit amazing videos all for free. I really recommend it.
This is basically video star but all the effects are free that is what I love about the app and is really easy to use
I was trying to make a video and it is not there
"Great editing app but could use more to it. More effects, transitions, and stuff like that"
When i first downloaded this app i had the option too add a style but it just disappeared all of a sudden…is this normal ? how can i get it back ?
Love your app but “style” button disappeared?? Please help
I was figuring a way to make velocity edits easier found CapCut now my velocity edit page which I get payed for making edits is ruined because there’s no style anymore for making velocity
So i have been wondering why i am not getting the auto velocity edit thingy and everyone else has it but me. Fix your app please
"This app is so easy to use and it’s free, there are many cool features and ways to edit."
Cap it is my favorite app you can edit add filters
CapCut was the first editor app I used its really good but I moved on to video star but I still use it for little edits
I love it it gets updates that make the app 10x better 💗
This is like such a good editing app no adds everything is free and just amazing
I saw that it was added in the app but it is not availible for me
I really like this app but I logged in to have my TikTok’s sounds but then my account got lost my it won’t let me log out of the TikTok sounds of my old account
So I stumbled across this app while I was worried I could not make any funny GACHA CLUB memes. This app worked perfectly! I love using it!
My sounds for audio are so behind from TikTok and every time I add a new sound to my favorites it won’t appear in the audio list
"Please add the 3D zoom option again
That was very helpful and good🥲"
Why can’t I convert a video into 4k on my iPhone 8 and only goes up to 30 frames
Hi I use Capcut on the normal but it takes up a lot of storage other than that it’s amazing way to go 😁😁😁 sincerely Fishy
"I love it like before 
Before 
- I didn’t have to keep doing the fonts every time I go off and back on 
- it was easier to use the fonts 
- I didn’t have such a problem"
The problem is it takes so much space in my IPhone
"This app is amazing but for some reason I can’t put any gifs in,may you please fix that?"
Omg I love this app you can use this so many thing and it makes vids so much cooler!
"So basically I got the app to create an overlay with two videos. However when I try to remove the background of the overlay video, to just the body it will cut out at a really odd angle . I tired this on several videos , and it’s not working 😪"
I was just making a edit and I accidentally went out of it and didn't export it. Then it says to much storage so I deleted like 400+ pics and vids and it still says it. I was literally in tears and now I'm thinking about quitting capcut. Can you fix this please capcut I'm literally I'm tears...
"It’s so amazing, it has no adds, no in app purchases, or slight features, and it’s entirely free!"
I don’t like but only part is I can’t draw and I really want to draw so it’s good but I want to draw
"It’s a really nice editing app and pretty easy for me. But it’s laggy, I add an overlay and the sound that I originally added doesn’t match with the original video."
CapCut is a good app but it tells me to clear storage when I only have two projects fix that pls or will keep leaving these bad reviews and get this add deleted!
Hi When I started using this app it was first hard until I got the hang of it but It’s really good for edits and Videos!
So yea I have been used this app for years really amazing this is a short review because I’m to lazy
Bruh I can’t wait so long for this app to load it takes forever to load 1 min and 2 2min and 3 like can u fix the app it’s ok I guess but try fix it 💀
"Capcut is the best editing app out there its super easy and great for tiktok edits, it takes a few days to figure out then its super easy and good."
"I loved CapCut. It creates beautiful videos with relative ease and makes me look good. But its best feature stopped working—auto captions. This is the reason I got the app in the first place. Until it’s fixed, two stars. PLEASE FIX."
It’s such a great app! And I really love it! There is no watermark which is very helpful!!! It has a lot of layers so put and helps me so so so much!
Can you please fix the lag issue when u add transitions and effects :D
I think it’s pretty good! Although one thing that kinda makes me sad is that I can add my OWN audio. But other then that it’s amazing
This app has changed my TikTok career thank you to the person who made this 😁😁
I already made 6 videos in 1 day the edits are so cool and you can make some very cool videos
"I love CapCut! But can you guys put CapCut on computers, Mac and windows. I like to edit on my computer and it would be amazing to have CapCut on computers."
This app is awesome there’s no adds or water marks from the app when you make a video 🙂
It’s a pretty good app but there are some bug and glitches
"So, It actually is a very good app I have it on my phone and my tablet. But it is a little confusing,But I love it!!"
I got this app a couple of months ago but its amazing the translations are free and you can make amazing edits!!
OMG! This app is so easy to edit with! I love it some much easier then Keinmaster! And the uploading is so fast! I love this so much💖
I love CapCut because the effects and animations you can do lots of photos and make great edits and it is really fun to make edits on CapCut
This app is amazing Iove it! If only we can get this for all apps that would be nice.
Please bring back the Auto velocity I can’t make my edits with the velocity its way easier to do.
All of it is good except for the fact that they TOOK AWAY THE STYLES SO NOW I CANT DO MY VELOCITY EDIT😡😡😡 I looked so hard for it just to find out that it was gone for everyone. Please add it back CapCut😀😀💀🔜
Please add 3d style back this was the main reason I got this app I love the app but I can’t do the edits I want with out 3d style
"The app is good I just don’t have the auto velocity update, I updated and reinstalled still not auto velocity…"
I love how this app is free and let’s you edit fast and easy good for beginners
All I have to say is too much but in short talk I can say it’s a great editing app ❤️❤️❤️
It’s awesome  everybody needs to check this app out I use it for everything
"This app is and but it still also delete all your work too when “make another copy” all the cuts, sound, and text disappear. Please do better."
Thanks for putting out such powerful editing tools.
This app is LEGIT GOOD I love it I use this to edit my video but my problem is that it is full screen and bad quality it’s 1080p I want 1080p60
So I’ve been using it for years and it was legit like amazing I really like the effects like you know
Do you need it because like it’s like the best get it right now y’all and yeah
I make Gacha club videos and this is the best app i have found for that!
This is the best editor I have used in years sometimes it can glitch but it has no ads ITS GREAT FOR BEGGINGER JUST WOWO i love this so much thank you for the great editer
I don’t really like the new update or version since it doesn’t save your previous data from when you used it before the update.
So I was thinking of being a gatcha tuber. And I tried so many apps when I saw all of the reviews I was pleased. But when I tried to download it my phone crashed. I couldn’t even see the app I’m still trying to download it but it’s not working…
"Please don't change the app.
Don't go the Videoleap route. This is PERFECT the way it is. 
Please, thank you."
I’m new to this app and l think it’s pretty cool and a little hard l don’t know about TikTok lm not really famous so my Dream is to reach to 80K nice and cool app
Whenever I try to post a long video I need to delete so much memory
I love all the music and all the things you can do on it
"If your reading this review, DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!! Almost every time I try to edit something, it says my storage is full. I deleted SO many apps and memories JUST for this stupid app to work and it says the same thing over and over again!!! I would rate it 0 stars if I could!!!"
Capcut is really great for starters! But it would be great to add graphs to make the edits smoother. But other than that its pretty good!
So CapCut worked for a bit then for some reason won’t load videos into the editing stage?
"i started using the app earlier this summer and loved it and still do today. i’m still a beginner editor and this app makes it super easy and simple for me to learn. it has great features and filters that make things look better. overall, great app!"
"If you want to do a quick edit and use shortcuts it lags out 

I had to delete it then reinstall but everything I made was gone"
This app is amazing I’ve made soooo many of my family members Smile cause of the edits I’ve done for them. Awesome app super fun
"I got on CapCut it said I don’t have enough storage but on the settings app it doesn’t say iPad storage
That’s weird
So pls fix
Sincerely.
A person named David"
so i’m trying to make an edit and then i’ll exit the app for 5 minutes for clips and adiuos and was working on a edit already and then it says infection in storage and i deleted photos and apps and it still won’t let me edit i’ve deleted it then it won’t let me re download
"So I do CapCut/after affects/ video star 
But cap cut is the easiest I would like it if capcut could have a smoother velocity it would help my edits a lot! Thank you"
"So this app is amazing the thing is I want more songs you know more new songs like bts,dojacat,etc so that’s all I want thx!"
"everything about the app is good except the quality, after a export the video it says it 1080p but it looks like 360p, rather then that the apps great"
"I like this app it's good for editing but whenever I put in exported audio it says ""video format not supported""? That needs to be fixed. Otherwise it's a good app"
It’s one of the only free editing apps and has so many options!
Why I love this app is Because it’s Not too complicated And it’s Easy to make videos! :D
I have heard a lot about this app...... and I know it’s an amazing app but I’m facing problems please help me.... i can’t use filters or other effects it’s showing I have network issue but I don’t I’m using other apps totally fine only CapCut is not working please help
I have made a bunch of videos on this app but sometimes it uses a lot of storage so that’s why I rate it 3 stars
Ok so the app Is ok for editing but the space is just 🗑 my friend and I had to remove so many memories of our first time on the app and other stuff and we had to delete it all just for it to not do anything :( please fix this it’s very annoying
Shakes need extreme work especially shake 1 and shake 3...honestly I think there needs to be less preset transitions. Volume and Video speed needs work
4
Honestly I love this app ! 10/10 one of my favorite editing apps
"I absolutely love it, it’s easy to put together edits and such, however, one star off for not a very wide variety of effects."
Better than any other editors that i've ever used. All in one video editor CAPCUT. Very Nice. (All Free)
"By far, the best editing app I’ve used! There are 100% no ads, no watermark, and no fees! I absolutely love this app-"
"I like this app, I edit with this app but one thing I would like to see one day is for the words, to be able to choose more than one “animation “ THAT WOULD BE GReat BUT TIL THATS POSIBLE I GIVE IT 4 STARS"
"This is insane! No water mark, and has amazing features! PewDiePie should use this editor."
I downloaded this app because I wanted to try to make videos and it doesn’t even let you down load any pics unless you have already chose some. This app is stupid gonna delete from my phone
"This is the best app ever! It’s completely free, works perfectly, and has no watermark!!! It’s so simple, but you can make amazing videos!!! I LOVE THIS!!!!"
My time with cap cut has been amazing! The editing capabilities are amazing! I recommend it!
I USE this app for a edit! And it works really well! I wish suggest one Transition is you should make a combo shaking the whole thing but ANAZINGGGG
I love using the app but please add style back because it does not appear for me anymore
I need no in app purchases totally free good for all ages
CapCut is definitely the best free editing softwares for beginners it makes it easy blurs faces with easy steps and yeah
"Hello! I love your app SOOO MUCH! Just one thing, could you put the text so you could do it like animations? Okay love your app, HAVE AN AMAAAAZING DAY!"
Hi there I was on CapCut having trouble I had to delete some of my video and I only had 18 left and when try to watch one of them it tells me to clean up my CapCut but I don’t because I only have 18 left please make more room thank you
It is a really good app to edit but it used to have velocity thing but it removed and this point of comment is . WHY DID U REMOVE IT😂😡
Was trying to edit earlier but the style button is gone?????????
"Ok I used to have the style but one time I was editing then I wanted  the style thing but I never saw it so I quoted but then I decided to search up what’s wrong with Capcut on tiktok and people were complaining in the comments so Capcut fix this
It’s very annoying"
My CapCut is version 5.7.0 but I still don’t have the auto velocity option.
A lot of peoples stabilizer isn’t working the same and nobody really knows why!- rest is amazing tho <33
I recommend for pros and beginners
Why dont I have the auto velocity option? I go to style and there are only 3 options… I deleted the app and downloaded it 3 times with the new version.
I tried to make mr incredible meams and I didn’t know what place to use and I descovered Capcut (capcut is the best in my opinion)
"CapCut is amazing and it does good editing but maybe add more features like animation, velocities, text animations, coloring, and effects?"
"thanks for this great app, please add support for right to left languages like Persian and Arabic in texts."
I didn’t get the update can you help me
"i love this app, i primarily use this app for edits. however, the lack of zoom ability and the difficulty of adjusting images (moving and rotating) makes it hard to use. i have to use the triple tap feature that came with my phone to make it easier, but even then it is extremely difficult to move the images."
Great program but I use txt to speech a lot …now it disappeared any idea’s?
So it’s a good editing app and all but really does it need to notify me when my storage is full? I just deleted 12 apps and it still says that.. I’m deleting and never getting this back EVER
"CapCut is a good editing app but, I have some minor issues like when I’m editing and try to put another slide all of my pictures are gone I’m sorry capcut but I have to give this a two star rating ☹️"
But capcut needs to put their slowmo a little bit better for my velocity’s videostar literally cost money for slowmotion but i know capcut will add very good slow motion 💕
Love the app but I really would like it if they added the velocity that video star has because that would be great!!!
This app is great for video editing! It has a lot of features to use.
"The only thing about CapCut is that you always need storage,I try to make a edit but I can’t because CapCut needs storage so can you fix that please?"
Hey I used this for a long time and this is very good I was thinking you should add more tricks and I do like it it just needs more tricks I think
Everytime I’m trying to add music it plays but when I cut the part of the music it play but it’s mute it’s a bug please fix this please
"Great app.
 If the support of Arabic and Persian fonts adds to the features of the application, it will be exciting.
Thank you"
The app is good but the one thing I don’t like is you can’t import a file can you please add that
"Super fun app I totally recommend it if you wanna start editing!!!
This app has helped me a lot! With edits"
CapCut is a good app but for some reason sounds effects are all Japanese or Chinese
"It almost has everything!!!! Though, I really want some more from it like erasing objects."
Hi capcut creator the edit looks good enough but idk how to clean my storage but I don’t have enough cuz could you fix that pls cuz I wanna edit it so much as i could.
"I loved capcut, it was cool. I could make anything with it, but to this day…I couldn’t make anything. It’s just, all broken! It kicks me out of capcut. Please fix the bug!"
"hello! i use capcut almost everyday and it’s awesome! it has beaitiful features and effects. one thing that annoys me is the “insufficient storage” i see it all the time. could you please get rid of it? it would make it a bit easier! besides that, the app is amazing! totally recommend it for editors"
I use the app 24/7 but the slow motion is not smooth
"The app glitches and bugs and when ever I put any effects on my overlay it don’t work! 
I love the app but please fix the bugs and add new effects."
It keeps saying I have no internet but it’s connected to that doesn’t make sense
"It’s a good app but, my videos keep lagging when I watch them I only see half of it but it’s a good app between that"
Omg to r has everything!I love this game so much and I can use it for so much things!this game has to be the best game I ever had!
Really insane
I cant get the update for the style option which will make my photo look 3D :(
"It’s not giving me the style options, like trimming the video or any of that it’s only letting me change the music"
I like it and all but the thing is. it keep saying “full storage” that’s the moment I get angry cuz RN I have 2 VIDEOS and it keeps saying that so yea.. I hate it BUT I ALSO LOVE IT
This app is awesome it has so many features that are great for editing and more
I love capcut it is amazing app to edit with and it’s really easy to use I use it everyday because I edit everyday HUH WAIT I EDIT EVERYDAY!!! *dies* 😀
Can y’all put some more transitions in it please I love this app !!!!!!!!!!!!!Y’all should make the transition more smoother
CapCut is great but when I take vid s it tells me to delete some storage and it basically it’s saying for me too delete the vid I took 😐
"Hey , the app is good . But every time I save it it’s off beat and I notice when I’m editing it starts to glitch. It’s not my internet .  That’s the only issue I have with it ."
So whenever I tried to add a photo from the “overlay” the images won’t show up when it’s supposed to
At first it looks hard but it’s actually not and you get pre made transitions
CapCut is one of the best editing apps I have ever used helps with overlays has multiple layers and no watermarks and it’s free
"I really love this app, the fact that it’s free and has good animations makes it amazing. Though I would like more combo animations, like a squeeze animation. Overall great app!"
This app got everything better than video star !!!!!
This app is truly a dream for some new editors! So easy and helps understand the basics.
"u should add shapes, like lines, circles, squares, rectangles, and stuff like that. It would make editing a lot better."
So for a edit I need 8 overlays but it only lets me put 6. Like I need 8 overlay pics but it only lets me put 6
Don’t get me wrong love this app but it has so many bugs it’s really giving me a headache I’ve been trying for hours to get this thing to work right but it will stop working at 15secs and gon I can’t wait to see how it works when I get to 20
"All I can say is wow, you made the best editing app ever, if I was your mom I would be the proudest out there!💕"
My wifi is perfectly fine but everytime I wanna use an effect/transition/sticker it says I don’t have “internet connection”. Is there anything I can do?
"Best editing app ngl because it make my videos very good quality, 720p with 60 fps is good quality"
I’m making this video and I really need a cute girl voice! It’s just like the cute boy just different pitch.
I downloaded this app because people were telling me it had vhs effect such as “rare vision vhs” when I downloaded the app I was completely disappointed please add actual vhs filters and effects.
Can you please bring the style thingy back?🥺 Edit: thanks for bringing it back :D
I need to make a velocity edit
"Every time I go on that app I experience really annoying problem, like uploading 1 image takes 20 freaking minutes.

PLEASE FIX IT!"
Its good but honestly I’m wondering why I can’t sign my google in I got a new device so I kinda want to get my old projects…
The work around trick that people are using isn’t that good
"Wow! I’ve had Video leap for some months now. When I saw CapCut and downloaded it, I fell in love with this editing app! 𝗩𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲."
It toook me for ever to find a good app to make a video and when I found the 🙀 I loved it so TY FOR MAKInG THIS
Good editing app. I just wish it would have better shakes and it wouldn’t take so long to make the good slowmo good
I am a roblox editor and I have a yt now and to edit my vids guess what I use CAPCUT OFC this has helped me grow Tysm CapCut
This app is sooooo good 10/10 good music easy editing once you get the hang of it
i love how capcut looks in the editing process. honestly this app would be perfect if it had the effects and transitions after effects provided. i do love how easy it is to cut clips and make some great amv edits. it just needs some more high end transitions and effects that could compare to a high end software.
So my friend told me to download this and ever sense i did i have been using it non-stop! Ty for creating this app!
With many free things other apps can’t do capcut is by far the best app I’ve ever edited on
This app doesn’t support urdu language please fix this issue
Please upgrade background photo thanks
When I go to edit a video after working on  another video it won’t let me see my photos
"It’s just that GOOD I’m a highlight editor, my yt is SwayWarm my Decals montage and The Best Edit You Will See Today, along with my sideswipe edit was done with CapCut!"
I’m a little good at CapCut the reason why I gave CapCut 3 starts it’s because when you have a amazing idea to do on CapCut and then it say iPhone storage full witch really bothers me
I like it but it’s not letting me use it now I have deleted all my photo and it stilled says to clear more out :/
"This app is so amazing and very easy to use, so many great features and fonts!"
It’s a BRILLIANT app but I think they should add graphs to iOS devices so us iOS users can use graphs as well ^_^
"I love to edit dogs with this app, just needs more updates."
But this is a really good app. I mainly use for Edits and Vfx And it’s pretty good 🤷🏽‍♂️. But i would like to have more transitions
"It always say “too much storage and stuff delete photos,apps,storage” I already did but. It says I still don’t have any storage I had 1,000 something photos and now I have 473"
I just recommend adding face distortions. If it did have face distortions then it would be a 10/10
"i use capcut 4 my edits and audio edits, super easy to use, not super complicated, and they don’t have cringey stickers, they have stickers that gen z enjoys, yknow more modern stickers i don’t use them a lot but that’s a plus but anyways i would recommend capcut to anyone"
OK every time I go on the app I try making a video for TickTock it’s saying I have to delete some and then I have an I delete one but then it tells me to continue deleting and then I keep deleting and then I had to delete all of them like what’s wrong?!?!?!!?!!!!!!!
"CapCut is perfect for a beginner in editing, and still good for people who aren’t a beginner. It’s got basically all the stuff you need to make a video- Effects, text, stickers, filters, audio and more! You can even import your own music if you want. There are no ads and the app is 100% free, which is a great deal, considering that it does have a ton of different features all in one app. I saw lots of people complaining about the insufficient storage thing, and how even after cleaning out tons of storage, well, that is a mystery to me because I guess I have a lot of storage? But it’s almost used up yet I can still access and create videos? Even if it is so, you could always just delete some more stuff, right? Or maybe I’m wrong, but anyways, I love how they are constantly adding new additions to the app, and I’ve noticed quite a few were requested by the reviews! :) I love that. Most people are saying how it still needs change. I think it’s already great, but true, it could always have more, I suppose! And the watermark you can remove very easily as well, which is amazing. And also I have an observation, I think it may be a bug or glitch or something, but I feel like this is a clue to a new feature CapCut’s gonna have. So, sometimes I will play the video back to myself to make sure it looks and sounds fine, or I will go to my exported audios and choose one I wanna add to my video. When I do that, the audio starts to sound different. The difference between the original and this other version is that in this version, if there were voices in the audio before, then the voices are all gone and it’s all instrumental! But then I play it again and it’s back to normal. So that is pretty interesting to me. What are you up to, CapCut? ;) But yeah. That’s pretty much all I have to say because I’m too lazy to write more. Thanks for finding this in the sea of reviews and reading it to the end."
I love CapCut bro like it helps me do edits and has really cool effects good blur and the slow-mo is okay plus it’s free y’all should really download CapCut.
"This app is awesome! But why does it keep saying CapCut need to be connected to album and it is!! I said confirm and it brought me I
To my settings everything was on ! Idk what’s it talking about!”"
"this app brings so much anger into my life. it makes me want to rip all my hair out. #1 it doesnt save anything, i had an edit that took me ab 3 hrs and i exited off of it. when i got on it again IT WASNT THERE. i ignored this problem for a while until IT DID IT AGAIN. this app is so bad tbh
  sincerely,alice trunchbulls fav"
I don’t usually write reviews but this one deserves it. Prolly the best editing app on the app store
"I’m on a iPad it’s just to much space
But I love all the stickers 
It helps me edit my yt vids
So overall I do recommend"
We just need more to effects
this app is good but it could be better. these are probably a long shot but i’ll still suggest it. so you know how keyframes work and such well i was think that you could adjust the effects with key frames. like how you can change the sharpen settings i think for example you should be able to do that with the blur effect.
I love the app but I wish the slow mo’s were smoother if you can fix that it would be awesome good app overall!
This app is the BEST editing app EVER!!! 5stars for sure! It’s the only app (for editing) that’s not app in purchase! And it has so many cool features!
i use this app for tiktok and i LOVE it! i love the effects and it is so easy to find them and make something amazing
"Hi! This is a very good app, but it takes a lot of space to make a video, Ive deleted over 400+ photos but I still can’t make a video"
"Ok, don’t get me wrong. This is an AWSOME app. No watermark, tons of effects, transitions, and more! But this thing that bugs me the most is how I need storage, when I clearly do. It really annoys me. I’m so tempted to delete this app. I’ll change it when I’m able to go back in the app. That’s that."
THIS APP IS COMPLETELY FREE WHICH I LOVE! This is very good with editing and it doesn’t even have a watermark which amazing and it’s very easy and amazing for making edits!
CapCut is good don’t get me wrong but sometimes when I’m makeing a edit it doesn’t save
I want an update that can type arabic correctly but all i can say this app is awesome 😎🤟🏻
"It’s a really good app for editing highly recommend, but I have a glitch on CapCut so at the same time I like it but do really love it."
This app helps me a lot to make cool edits. The presets are SO AMAZING! Everything else is too! Looking forward for amazing new stuff!
"i love capcut so much!! it’s a great app, hut i was wondering if you could maybe add more transitions? maybe like skew, 3d spins or more 3d things, tile spins/rotations, maybe a shake transition and at the end it goes out/in, and maybe more? also do you think you could add graphs to the keyframes and possibly motion blur?"
CapCut is a great app it has no water mark but for me it always says that I have infinite storage but it’s a good app to use for edits.
This app is really good but recently the bling effects won’t work and it’s really frustrating. Please fix this!
"Way better then KineMaster.....

It dosnt take as long as the other video makers"
"You deleted the style button, but why. Everybody loved it and now we can’t do velocity"
There’s a bug we’re it says I don’t have WiFi even know I do my WiFi is working fine so idk 😐 I tried reinstalling it that didn’t work
It’s a nice app but it keeps saying no internet connection when my internet is perfectly fine
i dont usually write reviews blah blah blah its a good app blah blah. Yes it does outshine most apps but i still use the other ones to add onto this app. pretty solid tho i guess. jot a bot review btw
I got everything I need on this app and now I can actually and freely enjoy making anime edits including regular edits 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
So when I try to add effects to the video I made its call saying “No Network” so I did a lot of speed tests to see if my net was low and it wasn’t! Please help me…
I love this app I use it do popular trends and when I want to edit
I can do edits and stuff but I can’t do the audio CapCut can you please fix that
I looove this app but I think I got a glitch because the style button disappeared...But anyway love this app NEVER EVER AND I MEAN NEVERR TAKE DOWN THIS APP (great job💖👑🎀)
I absolutely love this app not confusing at all but it been glitching ALOT lately. Like it doesn’t want to show my transition?
The app doesn’t even work and it makes you delete all your saved videos just to make a new video 100% do not recommend delete the app while you can
It won’t let me show the rest of the style!
Anyways I love the app Yeah that’s all I really have to say
Can you please make a crying sound efect? Thank u!
At first it was a 3 star cuz all the easy access but the smooth slow mo😫😫😫
It’s amazing 5 stars
So every time I have problems it’s says” Storage full” then it just makes me delete stuff for nothing!
"So, Capcut is a really good app but sometimes I will have NO videos in capcut, not that many apps and like 100 photos and it will say that I have no storage 😐"
"Super good! Love the star affects and the sounds! Perfect for editing my videos and pictures!
（„• ֊ •„)♡"
I’d say if you or your friends are new editors then this is the game for them! It’s good for any type of video like Gacha edits or green screens and more!
5 starts definitely should download
"I use capcut for all my edits, but please make the slow motion smoother. The slow motion is very bad :/"
"CapCut, you are such a good Editing app, but I really want newer and better shakes . Ty for reading"
I love CapCut but I hate when I full over layer please put more thx 😊
"I use this app as  a editing app but for some reason it won’t let me put pics and stuff on it it’s says I have pics or screenshots 
?"
"CapCut could you please add motion blur like video star and graphics please I would love it and use you for every edit I’m
Begging you please CapCut"
This is the easiest video editing app I found I learned so many things from it and it's just- AMAZING
"capcut is an amazing app to use for editing! it’s really easy for beginners too<3 one minor detail that capcut should include though is a smooth slo mo. the slo mo that’s already on the app is really glitchy and not what i want my edit to be like. but overall, this app is amazing and hopefully there will be a better slo mo soon!!"
So when I try and shorten or lengthen the text time it doesn’t let you do it by yourself it skips a lot and doesn’t get it to the exact measure you want
When I put croma key the Croma key dose not move to do green screen can some one help me fix it
"I like it but if they only put the arabic language or any other languages it will be better, that’s why i’ll give 4 stars"
I love capcut but it is hard to learn for beginners like me and others that is I want to to y’all and capcut
This is my fault but this app is awesome but I accidentally deleted one of my projects and a cant get it back please add a feature were you can recover them
It’s so easy to make simple things and it’s such a fun thing to do
This app is great! You can add animations and make any kind of intros! Its overall better the kinemaster
"Id like to point out ever since i got the newest update, IOS14.4, the app has been very glitchy."
I made a vid and all but why doesn’t it automatically download the vid I made it’s not good if your a youtuber use a different edit app this isn’t it
Its Saying To Connect To A Network Even When My Phone Is Connected To Wifi . Having This Issue.
This app is good don’t get me wrong but there a glich it says a have no more space when a barely have photo and apps yiu have to look in to that 🥲
I love this app one recommendation would be freeze frame i really need a freeze frame!! ty
When I tried editing for tiktok I didn’t let me
I think this app is amazing and super useful! It has smooth transitions for editing! I love it!
Don’t get me wrong cap cut is a really good editing app and there’s no watermark but.. it keeps saying my storage is always full and my storage is fine so CapCut please change that
This app litterly only lets edit one video and then tells me I have no more space the phone only has 15 apps and 88 photos like????
The app isn’t connecting to the internet hence I can’t load anything like effects or stickers etc. It keep saying I am not connected with the internet I tried all things but nothing worked
"Super easy to manage, 10/10"
Love this so much thing there should be face cam if your editing a video
"I love this app it’s perfect for making gacha videos 
I’ve been looking for a while and this is perfect"
The app won’t let me have a In/Out animation at the same time but overall great app
"it’s a good app to edit on, but sometimes it tells you that you’re out of space on your phone even though you’re not. & you can’t make edits or edit any video until you delete some photos or something off your phone. it’s really annoying, but overall a good app :)"
Easy to make edits with this app I definitely recommend it
y’all are a really good editing app but I think u need to add more transitions like and angle zoom or like a zoom in or a zoom out
I love love LOVE this all it’s amazing for editing I possibly use it for editing my anime edits! And they yearn out amazing no more funimate Lol but yes download this app it’s AMAZING
Erm it’s good in all but it’s asking for to much storage to do I video- so yea can you make it so we can have more room to do videos
This app is underrated and deserves more spotlight. You could use features that are not free on other apps. You should download it
Whenever I tried to go to my edits and won’t let me edit it and I can. Only touch in the screen to make a new edit
This app is so good I love this app thanks it’s better then all the other apps
I can’t upload the sound the edits a trash
"Looking at these other reviews, it might just be me, but whenever I try to use transitions/animation/filters it says I’m not connected to the internet. Except I am.

I tried redownloading, turning off wifi, updating to 2.0.0, etc but nothing works.
I’d like to give it a higher rating bc it looks cleaner than funimate, but I can’t. 

If someone knows how to get rid of this issue please let me know!"
It was good but after a while the auto velocity disappeared and I couldn’t do my velocity’s
it only shows some of my tiktok sounds…no specific order just 3 of my random ones out of all the other ones…might as well not use the tiktok feature if it doesn't work
Capcut is so great but the new update it has where there is no edit vilosphy that the only thing wrong otherwise everything else is great🙃🤟🏽😅
I love using CapCut. It’s my only editing app I use for when I make my edits for tiktok. It’s so easy and I love all of the transitions and effects❤️
I don’t have all of the features . Under edit and style there’s only two . I’m missing velocity for example . I’ve updated the app and redownloaded and it still isn’t available.
I have used this app a little bit and I love it
"It’s awesome I make a bunch of roblox edits but I have suggestions! 
Make a mask? Where you can cut out a character and put it somewhere else
And more animations 
More text 
And more effects!
Ik y’all already added some and there rly good! But maybe more? If it’s not to much"
"I’ve been doing very well with CapCut until around March stabilization stopped working, as of April the slow-mo option of better quality all of a sudden went bad as well. I’ve seen plenty of complains and they’re still not fixing it!"
I like CapCut cause it’s easy and free and no adds I would recommend it
I need a video and I work so hard on cause like I have to wait until it was safe and I’m so mad now because he like took a whole few minutes and it was so hot I gotta wait until my whole thing goes restart I hate it fix it now
"i've used a few other editing programs on both computer and mobile, and i've found that capcut is really easy to navigate. it's not great for complicated things, but its simplicity has made it my go-to program for media arts projects"
"Hi I’m a small YouTuber! Amandas house
214 subs and only one year of editing on capcut! So many to choose so 10/10"
I love CapCut it is such a great app for beginners! I love making Roblox edits with this app I love all the new effects! Highly recommend!
"I’m a beginner and it’s u know kind of hard 

But when you get used to it it’s easy like me"
Easy takes ten mins. Best editing video app
It's a great app but when i try to split a video it just ends it and it doesn't work out for me please fix the app
"add that song by the rock that goes
it’s about drive
its about power
Please."
I love the app the only thing that stops me from using it is NOT being able to use my TikTok saved sounds!! I have to keep uninstalling and downloading it over and over so they will re apear.
I try to download but it isn’t working help 😭
this app is amzing I love it sm and the fact they added new text organized it more is just AHHHH am so happy I love this app sm <333
"Please let everyone send longer videos, hear me out this is a great app but there should be some changes…"
capcut is amazing but it takes up so much storage it became a huge problem! It soon was using 114GB!!!
"hi I use this a lot but,
I can not use tiktok sounds since the new update
please help"
I really love CapCut but it’s asking me for billing info when I try to download it but this app is free is it not? Pls help me solve my problem I really want to use CapCut to make my videos because I also use videostar I canceled my subscription on another app I’m mad rn because I NEED CapCut pls help I will sue you.
Takes forever to uplaod a video. I was trying to uplod a 0:06 second clip and it took over 1 hour to uploded from trying over and over. This needs fixed. My only issusue with the app.
It was a mistake erasing this app it was really good my last video got so much views (Yt) why did i erase it 😔
CapCut this is for you CapCut is one of the best apps to edit BUT it’s not good I edited for 2 days now and it deleted everything I am crying I worked so hard I recorded when I won my diamonds and that’s on roblox royal high sunset and I recorded when I won than I deleted it on accident and now I’m mad and CAPCUT GIVE MY EDITS BACK
Capcut lacks picture quality
"So I download the app, it’s great. I edit my video. Continue editing until I get to 5 drafts. I had to go. So I left. I come back only to see ALL my projects are gone. This is VERY inconvenient. Especially when I worked hard on those. Thanks for reading.."
"I loved this app for editing, it helped me get tiktok famous! Great editing app, keep up the good work, thanks!"
Capcuts a great editing app but I had the short cut  option but now  I don’t please fix this
Why does it run out of room so quickly I only had like 5 things and it’s like you have to many things delete like 4 of them
The best video editor. Now if I just had it on my desktop My life would be complete.
So if your a person that tweens most of the time there aren’t much layers please make lot of layers I love it but I beg you make more layers
I made a lot of edits this app is so good so easy to use love the effects pls you need to try this amazing app not lying this is such a good
"whenever i go to effects it wont work it it will just show me the capcut logo loading. I have deleted photos,reseted my ipad, deleted apps,deleted capcut and got it again  and nothing works!!! Its getting  annoying please fix this!!!."
A lot of people say “cap cut isn’t editing” but this app is awesome. That’s all. Got to get back to editing
Love this app but WHY DO I NEED TO OPEN UP STORAGE?!?! I need to make a video but I have to clear up everything all my old memories just for it to not let me and I can’t re have them and now they’re all gone please fix this
Hello! Capcut is awsome there is NO watermarks NO pay and is so easy to use i would deff recommend this app as editing
It’s really good but I think you should add motion blur it’s really hard to find motion blur on other app and I’m more familiar with CapCut and it’s easier
"Please update the program 
and fix the problem of Arabic language support in writing!!
thanks :)"
Great app but they need to fix the zoom effect and Halloween effect because they’re both bugged out.
"Super super GOOD, 3 month I was using Video leap, and I couldn’t even add sound or too many effects! But in the cap cut I can do EVERYTHING! I love it 🥰 ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
It has no watermark and it gives me exactly what I want and how it turns out like is always AWESOME!
Dont get me wrong I love this its the best editing app but you should add for animations “Add animation to all”
i love this app sm. i could marry it if i could. but i can’t. sadly. it’s literally the perfect app. it’s so easy and simple and i can literally make any kind of video. this app is a gift from the heavens. it is better than any other editing app i’ve ever used.
"There’s a glitch where you’d split the video and apply transitions. It’ll become choppy and unpleasant. Please fix, 💀."
No In app purchases or premiums for a super powerful video editor. This app is really amazing.
"CapCut is amazing! Love it so much! The stickers text, it’s all so amazing! I have no complaints and it is super easy for beginners!"
Everytime i try to put an effect it just crashes my phone
I like it but it’s not real editing really. It’s just a whole bunch of presets “b-b-but I use key frames” and that’s why it’s choppy!!
I love CapCut! But for sounds it says no internet connection all the time which is fine.
Amazing app I would definitely recommend!!
"I love the app, But I hate that after the video editor it shows a picture saying Calcutta but anyways 4/1-2 outta 5!"
"When I download a video it says they can’t
access my photos and I only have 4 setting for it"
Your app is helping my brother get a scholarship
This app is great but my videos never export and it’s really annoying. It always says that something went wrong and I’m on the verge of not using it anymore. Very disappointed.
I woke up one day and said hey I wanted to do some editing but when I go onto the app I deleted everything that I’ve done I am sad and I can’t do anything about it.😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😤😤😤
Y’all have to fix the tweening like i’m not even moving it and its moving
"Since the last update 5.0, when changing the video speed, I get super choppy results. 
Yes, I film at a high frame rate and it’s still bad. Even when speeding up my footage it seems choppy.
Love the app besides that. I hope this gets fixed soon."
I’m mad cuz i can’t send things to my friends or work on an edit when I don’t have storage plz update it!!! Thx
So I’m a beginner editor and editing in CapCut was so easy and it has a lot of amazing stuff
"This is a wonderful app.
I use for yt videos and they turn out wonderful
Voiceover for free!!
That’s seriously amazing CapCut!
I used to use Picsart but I decided to change over to CapCut and that was an amazing choice!!
So easy to learn to use and so amazing
Picsart is the opposite unfortunately.
But keep it up CapCut!"
It’s good and i love to use it for my Gacha videos but there one problem it have max overlays so I can’t tween 😕
"A good editor, a fantastic one even. That’s FREE. And doesn’t force you to have a watermark."
I like it I just don’t like it cause it doesn’t let me upgrade the app on my iPhone so I can’t use that graphs or anything I hope y’all can fix this
"I really like this app, maybe you can add QR code’s for editing templates like video star?"
"i am very impressed with capcut. it taught me how to edit and my edits make my friends laugh. this app makes it easy to make animations and gacha videos with little steps. so, i’m very happy with this editing app, and i totally recommend it for beginners"
There’s pros and cons I don’t like how there’s like once you make a lot of vids then you have to delete a lot of apps that all but overall it’s ok
I just want to make a video in reverse but it would not work 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎it will always say sorry try again later I JUST WANT TO MAKE A VIDEO IN REVERSE……… But u won’t do it and if u want to do another video u know IT WONT DO IT 2 stars 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
i use this too edit all my videos 8/10
Its an amazing editing app and there is a lot of features I really love it
I hope that he will support the Arabic language
I would download it it’s good
"i love this app sm! i love how its free and theres no ads i appreciate it a lot and theres a wide range of transitions and other cool effects to add to your video that make it look awesome, this app is for beginners or anyone looking for a free editing app for videos/photos, i love it, keep up the good work <3"
Thanks but we really need a adult British and a girl British thanks If you do it’s thanks thanks
I don’t really like it because it takes off space
I don't like the voice recorder on the app it never works for me and it's very un helpful every time I try to record it's buzzing it's very annoying I tried fixing it but I can't.
So I’m a good YouTuber but now video’s were a thing before I started taking place with yt kids
Every 1 vid u make it says your Storage is full which gets me really mad so please change that but everything else is great!
When I record and finish I go edit
I love it I think it’s better then video star Bc it’s not so complicated and I love this app it help me so much❤️✨
"As a gacha that does full body animating with cap-cut, The main thing is the overlaying. Its pretty annoying so please put more overlays!"
All I gotta say is it’s better than video star and funimate
I love this app so much! It’s pretty simple to learn all the basics and it’s completely free! Edits come out so amazing! 10/10
"Very good, could use more text to speech accents though. Like child versions, more British accents, and maybe other types! :)"
I used this for 2 minutes and knew it was awesome
I really like this app cause u can add everything without paying like most apps.
"Ive been using this for a while now and... ITS PRETTY GOOD somethings it might need to work on tho is the rotation thing-
its so hard to rotate for me so- ANYWAY BESIDES THAT ITS AMAZING!!!"
There’s a lot of bugs that says no internet connection and don’t let me download the effects
I’m only mad because I can’t make it have an in animation and an out animation at the same time
I love it because it doesn’t take up too much storage and it has a bunch of great features! I have thsi on my top 3 list! Great job :)
This app is AMAZING but it would be better is if there was velocity to spice up some edits thank you💕
I love and support it but I wonder if you could add your own music and add glowing features
This is so cool! You can animate in it! Its just amazing. I would love to animate like cute cut though. So add that feature please?
ive been watching all turtorials to move things in capcut but it doesnt work im not sure if its a bug or im not doing it right but i know this isnt important but i wouod like to ask if you could change the way of how to move thing please😃
This is so good because I use this app most of time if I think my video is not good I use your app I love it
HOW IS THIS FREE!!! Like its my favorite program to edit with! And its 100 percent FREE! DUDE🤯 This feels like the best editing program. I don't have 1 recommendation its just... THE BEST!
I’ve tried so many editing apps and this is the only one that actually good. EVERYTHING IS FREE THERES NO WATERMARK EITHER!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS APP!
Please add a customization feature for the effects. Nice app though!
The effects won’t work whenever I tap on the icon they menu wont show up
Imagine being a video editing app and only having trim but not cut or anything else overall it’s OK but there better be an update that cut is a thing.
Your app is so bad and I can’t even get in and what ever I try I still can’t get in I keep on clicking new project but it takes me to my settings  and I try changing my settings but it still won’t work
Plz fix it I always make videos with and I want someone to fix this :( plzzzz fix it
"Amazing. I mean like, top notch editing. It could use a lot more fonts and transitions tho."
So I loved this app a lot it but now I can’t get to an edit that I have been working on FOREVER because it says the footage is corrupted when I have all of the footage downloaded and everything and I really need this edit so if you can fix this please do.
"what is wrong with the app. ever since like last month your app has been crashing. 
1. when i ty to add in audios, it never works. it either takes a while or i have to exit and re-enter the app. 
2. another thing is that when i import a video, it’s 3. always laggy. like why? 
and when i’m doing my velocities, the speed is always too fast. even if i do 1.3 it’s fast. 
4. the app has horrible quality. the quality makes me sick to my stomach and it’s so terrible. 
pls fix the app. this is like my 3rd or 4th review that i had to write over the course of 3 months complaining about terrible qualities in the app. capcut used to be good, i used to be able to make decent edits, but the app is terrible. pls fix it. thank you i guess."
"I love this app, super easy to use, and I always use it for my edits. There are so many free options! It’s amazing!"
Bring it back!
I really liked making velocity edits when i was to lazy to actually do the work and yall got rid of it?? 👎👎 should have kept it
"okay.. i have a problem with capcut. so.. i recently uninstalled it accidentally due to storage, but.. now i cant get capcut. when i try to install it, it always fails and never says anything. it just doesnt let me get it. i have no clue why but, if anyone can help me with this, please do so. :)"
Capcut is like my favorite editing app ever I would never use a different app to edit❤️
I heard a lot of good reviews about it. So now I’m gonna try it .
"Okay, I really don’t like this app because it won’t let me do it and I only have 3 videos that are like 22, 13 seconds and I suggest you try to fix that bug"
More layers even if I have to pay just please more layers
Hi
I don’t like it because it’s tell me I can’t do it or I don’t have enough storage when I have 200 and only used 49! 😔
Every time use auto velocity it loads slow and it says connect to internet
I love capcut so much it has helped me with so many projects and jobs thank you cap cut!!!
This is good but when my storage is not full it’s still says full
😲love it it's cool
I like this app it needs some better things like 3D letter effect and cammotion and cuting out things with key marks
best editor for mobile just takes some time to get used to it
I am grateful for CapCut aleast we have something to edit :)
This is a very good app. I’ve heard so much about it! And it very much lives up to the hype!
I love this app but when I go to add a sound from tiktok it says no internet but my internet works fine what should I do
"When it comes to choosing effects, they take too much time to open or download. Download can be slow but the thumbnails of every effects don’t open all the time."
"I’m very upset that every time I’m trying to save it, it says insufficient something it’s annoying it’s saying my storage is full it’s super dumb I delete everything it’s so annoying."
Not gonna cap when you learn how to use it it’s a pretty good app
"i overall love this editing app and he has so many useful things it can do when yr making a video but theres one thing that i hope can be fixed, so when i put in a video capcut will trim off some if the video on the sides and ruins the whole video and that really bothers me so i hope y’all can fix that"
Suggest: can you guys add like we can access our music in our files
When I want to do transitions it always says check ur internet but my internet is good
Is slow mow a thing
"I do love the effects, animations and etc.
But I do have some recommendations for new effects.

Effects: Flare, ice cold, steam, mountain glacier."
My graph won’t work but I still lov it
Capcut was good but then something happened. The overlays were glitching and wasn’t making my edits good as they did before.
“CapCut needs access to the album for editing and editing videos” literally all it says when I wanna make a video how do I fix it :p it’s really annoying
I’ve been using Capcut for ever and the sound is starting to be very glitchy:/ please fix this.
"Hello!, the app is amazing but I think that you need to put the slow motion like vsco , but the app is amazing 🤩 ty"
You should get this it is totally free best thing I have ever used
Your app made me delete everything in my photo memory when the app says you have to delete some photos and come back! I did and I still says that! I deleted 359 photos already that where my memory! Your evil
My 3D zoom effect won’t work can anyone help?
this app is really good the only thing that annoys me is that when i try to make something it says “insufficient storage” then i go to delete like a bunch of my photos and i deleted my other projects and it still says that but other than that i like it
Amazing and so many features
I’m sorry can cut but your new update is a lot harder to use. As an editor I liked the old set up but do you.
I love CapCut it’s so helpful. I would really recommend you use this app. Thank you CapCut!
Amazing editing app there’s so many different things! Highly suggest this app!
Hey great app! Its hard for me to use tho any tips on how to get better?
I wouldn’t change a thing about it. 😁😁
LOVE THIS APP ITS AMAZING. But I would suggest adding a feature that allows writers to control the speed of the effects
"This app is poggers!!! Its great for edits and theres alot of features! My only gripe is that theres no  
custom transition type thing, it would be really useful"
"I haven’t looked into it much but I haven’t seen a thing where you can cut out middle sections. I know you can trim it, but that cuts the ends and not the middle"
"After I edit a video and make another one , the video clip’s screen goes black and I can’t fix it for like 10 minutes. It keeps happening"
When I edit my video I can’t save it it says I have to delete some photos and I deleted 120 of themAnd it still doesn’t let me save the video... I got so MAD
"I love this app! It’s so amazing!!! So many great features! I just have a few suggestions to add to the app. More camera movements. Movements where you don’t need to do a “animation” and the camera is just moving or shaking or swaying like an effect. Just more movements! Camera movements brings life to the project! Also more richer filters. Maybe a filter where you can have only specific colors show and the rest is black and white or a different color. I would also like to do zooms in certain areas. You can choose where you want your camera to zoom and how much it will zoom in or out. More transitions as well! Maybe interpret the zoom effects with transitions but you can also have your own zooms put on top of the video (like an effect). And more lights like “leak 1”. The leak 1 is great, but I would like more like that. More lights that move around the screen. Different colors and movements. More lights for “effects” but also light movements on “transitions”. I would also like a bit more creativity with the text and typography. Maybe even make the camera follow the text. I would also like for more customization with audio. Maybe you can make an audio clip sound more static or sound if it’s coming from a tv. Overall great app, and I would love if the developers decide on adding these features! :) 

To sum up the features I would like added is: more camera movement (as an effect), more creative typography, richer filters, more lights with different colors and movements (like leak 1), zooms as an effect and your choice of placement for the zoom, more audio customization, and more professional looking transitions (not the cheesy type)."
I like it but today I tried getting in the app my whole screen froze 😭😭😭😭😭😭
This app makes things easy. Anyone can make good video edits with this app.
I use it to make my tik tok gaming clips! It’s absolutely amazing and def recommend getting
This is a amazing app because every thing is free(I think) and like I’m not good at editing on video star
I hate this app bc when you have full storage it doesn’t let you edit and you have to delete your stuff like ugh🙄🙄💀😭💀😑😑😒
"I LOVE this editing app,but the problem is,there’s not a lot of features."
"I love this app so far, 100% free, no watermark, and no ads. Its amazing and totally would recommend :)))"
I REALLY like this app it’s so easy to use please don’t change anything about it ❤️❤️❤️🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
See I’m trying to make a edit and it lagging and stuff I’m just trying to make a edit for naruto now fix this lag!
Girl where is the style button don’t play with me
"This is a perfect video editing app with one BIG glitch:

There is no support for Right to Left languages (Arabic, Persian,…) and it makes it impossible to use when we need to add RTL text to videos…"
I love the updates CapCut makes and it is really easy to use! I always use it to make new edits!
It was good TILL I lost me style and I can’t find it anymore I CANT find my audo velocity in style cuz my style is Gone I NEED MY THING (not in a rude way) I’m actually sad now and I don’t know what to do anymore
It needs to be a little better with the support and storage. I make one video and it says I’m out of storage
I have video clips with audio that continue making noise after I cut the video shorter. There is no way to stop the audio from continuing into the next clip. Extracting the audio does nothing
This app is pretty good I use it for velocity and other things but it always take up storage
"ok so starting off, im in love with capcut it's so easy to use. it comes with a ton of effects for free and all the stuff u basically need. a downside though, the slomos are choppy. they're low fps and the app doesn't have the best quality. just a suggestion, motion blur would be nice, graphs, and a cleaner slomo. everything else is perfect though"
"Is one of the best application
 I have had of editing it deserves 5 stars"
I really enjoy using this for editing it is super easy!!!
Dear cutcap I love ❤ you ideas but it's hard to find things
"This editing app is pretty good and simple but I’m having a problem with the Tik tok sound. Whenever I favorite a sound on Tik tok, it doesn’t show on CapCut. Can you fix that or do something."
It deleted my project that I have been working on for hours and it just was not a very good experience
"Amazing app 😸😸😸

Helps me edit my gacha memes and vids 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

Very cool effects 🙀🙀

And the apps free😼😼

💯💯💯💯💯💯

Also if your making a gacha meme and you wanna edit the picture you need a different app (idk which one help) but cap cut is  for the cool animations and sound effects and effects in general 😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎

Thanks CapCut 😇😃😇😃😇"
Hi all I’m gonna ask is can you add more effects 🌸
Everything’s free it has everything i need!
"When I’m try to make a short cut it takes forever to load, I’ve been waiting for a hour and stilll nothing."
I Love This App But I Now Have A Problem Where If I Cut A Audio Clip The Part Of The Audio After The Cut Won’t Play So I Can’t Use The Rest Of It Only The Part Before The Cut
Me and my friends love it great for gacha tweeting and dance videos :) everything is completely free and no ads love it!
So after i came with capcut it was refectionble it is a nice app to edit i love it more when it’s refectionble
This app is so amazing I love it you should try it out it’s not that hard it’s pretty easy
Can u please let me update it
This is by far the best video editor I have used. 👍
"My photos are keep going the color black i love ur game but its not working 😢so plz fix this and stop saying ""not enough storage 😢"
It helps with a lot of editing I just got it but it seams really helpful
"It’s a great app! For new editors, yet after using it for awhile it ends up taking up ALOT of your storage. That is the only issue with the app."
I saw when i get a new app cap cut tell me delet some apps or somthing like that when i delet it i need to delet cap cut and download it
"i think that a great feature to add would be the ability to delete a singular spilt when it is no longer needed by tapping on the spilt and a button you could press after tapping the spilt to delete it, this would really help me out a lot and i’m sure others would enjoy this feature as well"
Now I can do funny videos (: highly recommend.
I recommend!
"It all in all very good, but if adding 3+ effects it can get really glitchy."
I love this app so much.I think it is easier than kine master!You can add pictures rec and more!Its is SOo helpful
I love the app but idk if it’s just me but it’s really glitchy but other than that everything is good!
Thank you so much for creating this app and making it COMPLETELY free. Bless you guy🥺
I don’t like it a lot because it won’t let me press overlay when I try to edit and it annoys me…
This editing app is amazing I love it it haves no ads and it is perfect there’s no reason it should be bad cause it is fantastic
It’s great I can slow down the songs I have on cap cut I actually love it
I make forza edits on my tiktok for a few days now and it works pretty well
"a great app for beginners! my personal favorite part is that it has no watermark. but, i kind of dislike how you can't make your own transitions. maybe make an option to customize the animations? but other than that, capcut is really good."
This app is awesome! I can’t think of any other app i had that was like CapCut! It’s amazing!! Five stars!! 👏 👏👏👏👏👏
This is great I really love this but could u pls add some new transitions pls☺️
"I think this app is really good it’s better than TikTok. Really great for editing, but every time I try to make a new project it’ll say I have “insufficient storage.”"
Low key better then video star 😳 and it’s completely free
Can u do the saber affect plz I beg
"Don’t get me wrong, but it doesn’t have a way to recover ur videos! I lost a very important project that I had been working for a long time and I haven’t heard back from the developer yet! If you can please get me my video back it was very important!"
I literally use an iPhone 12 and every other app in EXISTENCE runs smoother than this piece of garbage. I got it to follow a fun trend but the app crashes the second I click an image to import. Awful. Would rate 0 stars if I could
It's  a great app but i do yt with it and it's okay but if ur a ytr then i would recommend something dif but if u like it that's great!!!! My yt channel Is CooolQueen 023
THIS APP IS SO FRICKING AMAZING i get to edit all of my videos without a watermark and it’s super easy to use
Very nice i love it! easier than other editing apps!
It’s super underrated it has a lot of options!
"First, its an amazing app; but it has a couple of bugs. I can’t extract any music from videos. Please fix this!"
The best video editing app I’ve ever used it’s simple and easy to use.
This app is absolutely amazing. i just might use this app forever :))
Tbh it takes up a lot of space just for a simple edit try lowering the space so I don’t have to use so much of my GB.
I can’t flip the camera. It will continue to stay backwards. This is really annoying because I can only have the camera on selfie once a day!! Ridiculous!! 🙄🙄🙄🙄
"I was just trying to use ‘style’ on this app for velocity edits, and it’s no longer there. I’m thinking about deleting this app because it was the main thing I used it for.😕"
Where did the style button go?
Well I like the app but I keep having to delete stuff to use it and it annoys me
Good but a bit confusing sometimes but good and fun also quick.
It doesn’t let me go on my pass videos and it will freeze up out of nowhere Like put the old update back nothing changed just the colors of the buttons
"Nothing needs to be changed I am 9 and this app is amazing.

Lots of benefits. Great editing"
This is a great app that’s all I gotta say. I just wanted to show support to my fav editing app🧟‍♀️💗
NO! Do not download! If you are wondering why it’s because of the stupid camera it will not flip the camera! Like it won’t do anything it will just like literally flash and and do nothing please fix this God I can’t believe this.
"Wow, CapCut. Your so buggy! I tried adding a text for a video, NO ANSWER! It just froze! Nothing worked! I tried multiple times! CapCut, you better fix this! Last time I tried to write a review, it made me give 5 stars! I tried to give like 2! FIX THIS. NOW."
"Music from tiktok won’t show up, keeps saying “Commect to internet” when my iPhone 12 is connected to internet. Rating will go up after it’s fixed."
This is an awesome app and thanks for this.  Free to use free to express my creativity and free get contents out.  Thanks again
This app have a problem that we can't write arabica !
It look nun like the pictures and all the good stuff u gotta pay for it
"I love capcut but I hate how when u delete it, it doesn’t save your edits. But other than that, amazing app!😊"
"I love the app but I was wondering if you could add more transitions like 3D transitions , flashes , etc but overall it’s a really great app"
Pretty hard to edit and very non-user-friendly. It would be nice if it was easier to edit on the screen with your finger but too many things going on and the system gets very confused.
"I love the effects, it’s easy to learn how to use it as well. This is the best editing app I’ve ever used"
But can you guys make the slow mo better?
Hello this is a great app but ONE this I hate is bc u have to delete and it’s hard I need all the apps for edits and I’m so sad to see my hard work goo :(((
Capcut is easy for pros and beginners! I use This for all my videos from edits to vlogs (this beats iMovie) 😜
"After I cut the video where the beats are and try to add transitions , when I replay from the beginning it skips . The sound skips and the video ."
i love this app so much i learn just in seconds it helps me for my channel this is so amazing but sometimes when i want to add a picture all my pictures are gone and i have to restart so pls fix this bug amazing app
I’m a small YouTuber we and love to edit and this app was my favorite but now it doesn’t let me export my videos it just keeps saying error try again
We need more animations! Wejust need some more better ones!!
I’m doing my edit I’m cut my videos part by part and every time I play the video the second clip starts then stops then went on the next clip. Then at the video of my video clip it wanna start playing the rest of my videos . 😕
More transitions longer templates and kinda make it so you can’t only make perfect edits on templates and fix internet more animations
The only reason I downloaded this app was to have auto captions but they don't work.
"I love capcut but I also hate it , the app made me delete photos and videos and it still won’t let me edit something, I only have 10% of my gallery"
Normally I LOVE this app and use it all the time but since the newest update it won’t caption any of my videos. I’ve tried everything. I’m extremely frustrated
So the app said i didnt have enough storage so i deleted some photos. It said yhat agaon after so i deleted 400+ of my photos and ots still saying that i dont have enough storage.
"I just recently updated the app and now when I try and play the video while still editing, it will not play. I use this app to edit for TikTok. I am very disappointed that it doesn’t work anymore."
Why has the style been removed
.
"So I love this app, but I deleted ALL my projects because I needed more storage, and mostly ALL of my photos and it still said I needed more storage. I deleted the app and I’m going to try again soon."
Is anybody else having trouble loading after the update yesterday?
Everything you would want in an editing app. Love itttt
Amazing App and very Useful for my Videos and makes it easier to Edit. Love the App!
It’s an Amazing Cool app I Love it a Lot No watermark and you don’t have to pay for anything and all the transactions are cool and Free !!
So I love CapCut and the new auto velocity 😍😍 but can you make like 3D element if it’s not too hard to ask 🥰
What happened to your velocity setting??
"I love this app! I’m a beginner editor and this app helps me a lot with learning tricks,"
All is good but I don’t have all the features. Please give me all the features
this app is very good but it could use some work so i would just be working on a video and then i would open the app and sometimes it would say something like my storage is full but that shouldn't really matter.
"It’s Great! And it doesn’t take up that much space!
It’s really good for me! U should get it"
I can do everything but sometimes it gets laggy and I can’t use some stuff and now I’m having a problem using the velocity:/
I’m a kid and I could use this so I bet you can and it’s FREE
I LOVE THIS APP some times it gets hard but  no ads or no losing money I love it so bad thank you all
GREAT APP
Im Thankfully and just wanted to say great job. This app is awesome and easy to use for me 😀👏🏼👍🏼
"So the app is fine I guess but I was in the middle of making a video that took forever and guess what, CAPCUT reset the whole thing where every video I ever made was.. gone.

I hate this"
It keeps ob saying my storage is full but i deleted every photo in my phone and it still wont let me 😐
It’s nice and very fun and easy to use but I would appreciate more overlay layers. 6 is not enough for some editors!! Thank you! ✨❤️🙂
"I try and try to look up videos but nothing seems to work but u guys should try it,"
I cant open any of my projects because “I don’t have enough storage” I emptied all of my storage and it still won’t let me open anything. I’ve tried restarting my devise. Nothing works. Please fix it
I need to add voice so you can find what you’re looking for
Really good app works really well and helps you make cool videos for free
The app is free but can make a PC  version and it’s my #1 editor to use
Ok so I deleted it last month and I want to download it today and it doesn’t let me
It’s a nice app but I would like it if you can bring sounds from TikTok to cap cut but other then that it’s pretty great
add velocity and graphs! you could get way more downloads!
I was trying to do something nice and cool but I couldn’t because with the foot it kept going straight and vertical because of the stupid thing to have it be straight. And it kept going off center with the key frames.
1: I learned so fast 2: it’s Awsome! 3:thanks to the creator I get to show my friends and family my edits
I love everything about this app so much and everything it free in the app!!!!!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️love it.
This app made me delete all of my pictures and it still doesn’t let me make videos the app is annoying just pls fix that
Don’t get me wrong I love this app we can do edits and stuff buttt I don’t rlly like how u guys made it Spanish I want it bck how it was I don’t rlly like the Spanish but it’s a good app to make yt vids and edits but yea I love this app 🙈❤️
It’s perfect I love it’s cause It is easy
Capcut is so cool! I use it all the time with my videos. I am a Potter head so I need a lot of videos and photos to use on my videos!
i kept trying to find an app as og as this one. so many features and so much cool stuff. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. and also (this is a message to CapCut) DONT CNANGE A THING. ITS AWESOMEEE
This works perfectly!
"I used to love this app but then I started using alight motion but I decided to use this one more time and when I put in clips it would stop a random times...it was annoying, I don’t know if it’s just me but it’s annoying"
I downloaded this because tt made me teehee well have a nice day to whoever is reading this😘
The only thing I don’t like about this app is how long the transitions last.
"This app is so cool! Best editing app of the year! Totally recommend, it also has no watermark! ❤️"
When I went to go re download it said open but It wasn't downloaded so I pressed open and it wouldn't open can you fix it?
"I love this app so much! But I think you should add custom graphs , this app is amazing and easy to!"
Capcut is a good app but it freezes and then continues the video it makes the video look weird.
This app has everything an editor would love and need.
when i try to use auto velocity it lags alot
Best edit app out there and im not a paid reviewer this is fire💯
i updated it to the newest version and THERE’S NO FONTS! do y’all know where they went?
Pls
Please add the style button back .
I don’t know what happened but when i came to edit on capcut suddenly my style button was gone?
Okay so I love this app so much but for some reason my 6k and 4K aren’t popping up can y’all please fix that for me🥺
I’m not going to lie this app was the app that got me into editing I want to think capcut and the developers for that. <3
"I’ve been using this app for a while now and no issues. Today I’m editing a video, saved it and the screen is completely white….. 

I updated my app and now the app isn’t working. I’m very upset"
"Um it’s not letting me save my fake movie 
And it’s saying retry and it’s getting me mad"
Love Capco so much by it will not even buy it do you wanna know why because it’s free
Auto velocity still isn’t working. Wont pop up when I go into style. I updated my app deleted it and it still won’t work.
When I open the app my edits are deleted but then I reopen the app and my edits are back but I have a problem if I try to edit my phone will say not enough storage and I just got this phone fix please
Honestly this was the defining feature for this app. Will give 5 stars if it can be fixed otherwise it’s a 2-3 at best.
"This app is amazing and I love capcut, but
you should add graphs!!! It would be so helpful and
more people will use this app"
I love CapCut but there’s a bug.. when I want to add an over lay the over lay goes crazy and flings around my screen… when I try stopping it it glichtes non stop for about 20 seconds. Please fix it.
im an editor and i use VSCO to slow videos down since its smooth but capcut you NEED to add smooth slowmo PLEASEEE
"I was just using graphs and it zooms out when I try to move it in through the transition, fix this please it’s like the feature I use the most and there’s no point in this app without it."
I was going to make a video and when I come back to CapCut all my videos was gone and I lost everything and has to restart! Fix this bug or I quit!!!!!!!! It keep bugging some time and I hate it! Fix it before I quit using this so I it don’t gitches. E anymore
Capcut is very good but like when you have like storage left it still dosent let you make videos
H
Someone help how do you put it patriot mode help please
This app is great the thing that throws me off is the fact that sometimes I can’t find what I want
This is the bast and nice app i use for  editing 😍 . Add more effect   .  Thanks  Capcut family for  the   Nice and cute app 🥰
Great app but it asks to access my photos and every time I say yes it freaks out and had no options
CapCut I have deleted like 85 photos and videos and your still saying please upgrade your storage or something and I would have gave this a 5 star but you keep saying it!!!
I deleted CapCut and cant get my edits back how do u get them back?👁👄👁
Great app but My gallery litlerly has less than 100 pictures. And it says i have to delete some for it to work again! Please fix this
"I suffer from a problem, please solve it. I suffer from interruption or interruption, and I cannot play the video. You can solve the problem"
I love the app so much I post my edits on TikTok but I just want to know how to get CapCut pro.
So far it’s pretty good overall but when ever I edit it I try to add layers of edits and it doesn’t work it makes me frustrated. Please fix it.
OMG guys you have to get this app it’s amazing and 100% free!! It’s so good it literally I would get it even if it cost money
This is the best app ever!! It’s so good editing everything is free
Hnnnn
"i actually really like it! it’s easy to use and learn, it has good options for sounds, splitting clips, changing the speed, adding overlays, timing, effects, zoom in, text, and more! the only thing i would like is more transitions to choose from, but over all it’s really good :)"
"It’s a really good app, but when your video gets kind of laggy when you export it"
It’s my new favorite editing app lol
"I actually like this app, it’s free and it always downloads your edits! It’s only crashed twice for me"
Good app but freezes sometimes
How do you add photos and videos because I can’t and it won’t let me
I was in the middle of a huge edit and now I can’t get back in it won’t let me tap it or edit.
We’re did styles go? Are you not going to add it back?
With everything going on today why is the age 4+ that doesn’t make any sense that’s really sketchy also all the “goood reviews ” are from a few hours ago yea I’m sure is a good app but the sketchiness y’all
Great editing software. Use it to edit my madden videos
Please never change this app! I love it and enjoy all of its features!
Best editing app ever it’s not so hard to edit on this app if u just learn recemend!
capcut why did you take style out💀
This app is so good just needs mirrored tiles. I normally use key frames more than pre made animations and the background is black it looks very weird .
I keep making a edit and i a upload it and when I press post to tiktok it Brings me to tiktok But it Does not post it
I was new to editing when I got it but I got the hang of it easily.
I loved this app and I still do its very easy to use and I love it love you
"Hello, the app doesn’t want to update for me,
I tried so many times it just doesn’t and I can’t delete it because I have my progress there. Hope you fix this soon"
"- actual motion blur not just a an effect.
-more custom 3D effects you can make one your own
- smooth slowmo 
-more effective effects for glitch style anime/kpop edits 
-actually smooth velocity station

That’s about it I haven’t used this app in months"
It sometimes kicks me out and restarts everything I worked on now I’m trying to re download it and now it won’t work :/. Two stars.
"The app is great but just one request the 
Animation combo Distort right and left to zoom out then in"
Every time i tey to remove the background on a png picture it doesn’t fix please it’s so annoying.
CapCut is a amazing app! It helped me with all my edits and made my videos look better! Thanks CapCut.
Cap cut insnt letting me edit even though I deleted my whole camera role.  Good editing app but bad storage limits
I think it’s to easy to use (in a bad way) there for the results come in bad unless used professionally
All I ask from you is that you make the slomo speed smoother and better! Have a great day!
I love capcut but i think a motion blur would be a great addition to the app! A ton of editors use it to make the video smoother so I’m sure it would be super cool to have it:)))
"CapCut is Kool, but I hate when I have to delete apps, photos, just to make one video, once I try to make a video, I have to delete more apps just to make ANOTHER VIDEO"
what is this capcut you dont let me do anything!
It works so well and the fonts this is just amazing i love using cap cut for my edits ✌️
It said there is to many overlays so I had to get kinemaster 😒
"I love to make movies with this app and edits 
I highly recommend this app"
capcut to me is not very well when I try to edit or all the other things you can it either glitches or does not work no matter how many times I try
Overall it’s good but a little hard and they need to add better effects like please
I love it because I am a noob at making videos🤣🤣this helped me so much
And help me get it
"When I got capcut the 30th time I am so mad, 1 because it says clean up photo storage I deleted an app I cleaned up all my space this is not fair you might get sued and now I dislike this app and 2 I rate this 1 star because this is not a good app"
I Can’t even use the app when I tap New project it Says “InSufficient storage. Clean up some phone storage and try again” I deleted half my photos and 4 apps and still continue to get that message
This app helps with so many things!
Today I was going to get on CapCut because I wanted to look at one of my funny edits and then for some reason it deleted all of my edits. Don’t  download this app if you are going to make important edits. Please don’t download this app. It’s horrible
"this is by far the best editing app i’ve ever seen BUT I CANT WITH THE F* LAG, i make my best edits and when i add a bit of of stuff ITS SO LAGGY PLEASE FIX THIS IM SO TIRED OF THIS"
I just love this this helped me so much and I have spent no money on this!
Recently everytime i try to add a transition it says  unable to connect to Internet
ok I’ve been using this app for like one day and omgogmogmgogmgomg beuh this app is amazinggg and free????? whoever made this app muah muah now i can make swag bts edits
Could you maybe add a motion blur?
I love editing with this app I think it’s so fun to edit with this app
Broo Am having a nightmare because I just got it and it said full right away like dude this app. Also Its kinda good and all. Its just the full photo things. Please fix it thank you.
I never rate apps but this NEEDS one!!! I love this app it’s so easy to use!!!!! The editing is perfect pls keep updating it omg I love it!!!
"It’s a very great app with editing don’t get me wrong, but when I click on text or overlays it wouldn’t work it wouldn’t do anything but the app is a ver very awesome app!"
It is pretty good but I have been trying to use it but was frozen as usual. But if you don’t want to pay for editing app then use capcut
this app is so underrated. i love all the filters and effects you can use. all for freaking FREE!!!
"Capcut, I love your app but can you at least not make “auto velocity” off beat?"
I love it wow I do so many bc of this it has the best features
This is a super good app to use if youre a YouTuber it really easy to play people should get it!
I love this app
For some reason I don’t have the style option to do stuff like velocity and stuff 🙁
I have a bug where the transitions max speed is 0.4 seconds can someone help me
This app is super good for editing and good for beginners! And I love how there adding new effects
Me personally I think this a great app for editing and more but in my opinion you need to add a little bit more stuff!!😶
I know how to put music but I want to put the type of music I want.
"this app is very good although,it takes up a lot of space"
"this app is nice overall and there are many cool things you can do with text effects, but there’s not a wide variety of fonts. this app would be better with the option to import fonts 😼"
"This app is amazing,free and has helped me with my video editing dreams! keep it up CapCut!"
Im sorry but dont add the new effects tho its very bad
THIS IS A AMAZING EDITING APP!! But it’s rlly glitchy and it won’t let me do the slo mo effect which I’m not in love with . But overall this app is AWESOME 😎! Another great thing is there are no adds !!!!
"I love this app so much,it helps me to be better at animation and more"
Are used to have this app but I never used it and I’m gonna use it and I can’t wait so I am super happy yeah I bet this is going to be the greatest app ever bye!

"Ok so like I use gacha life and tiktok and I thought capcut would be hard to use, but its actually SUPER EASY!!! 10/10, def reccomend."
I downloaded the app and it kept saying”storage unit full”I deleted all my photos and videos off my iPad and phone and it still kept saying “storage unit full” dude I deleted lol my photos and videos for what? Nothing this app is useless
"Very Very Good editing

This is WAY better then funimate
It’s incredible how it has so many free things
I wanted to make edits for my instagram page and this app is the best for that
Is the best app ever it dosent charge u eanything and it’s just wow my friends r I pressed by my edits thx so much for bringing this app
It’s the best it blows up my TikTok accounts I love it some much
I liked using this App but after a while it just won’t work at all so now I have to go and find a new app to use.
"I hate this app so much I make 3 videos how is my storage full, this app could die and kill its self and I don’t care if this is an app I wanna make an protest ccsbylia is my tik tok make a protest with me cap cut is literally mind blowing like it thinks it’s famous."
"every time i remove the background for an overlay, it’ll do it but once i remove the background for another overlay it’ll cut it out the same way as the other photo. not sure if that makes sense but please fix that. i tried exiting the app and going back into the project but it doesn’t work"
App Is Great I Love It I Just Need My Style Option Back It’s Not Showing
"Now tell me, why the HAILL did y’all freakin remove auto velocity and style? I need that to show my sister something cool and y’all are just out der removing the main things mother truckers use yo app💀 updates gets worse n worse.."
"i love this app, i use it all the time!! but the thing is, i’ve updated capcut like 2-3 times and i still don’t have the velocity option. this kinda makes me upset as i’ve been waiting for it to be an update. so if you could, please fix that."
"Ok first, the style button is gone? I really need it and it just randomly disappeared ever since i dont like this app unless style button is added again. Capcut that was the worst thing you did"
Slight problems but easy to work
Edit style does not work for me😢
Okay editing videos is good and all but it's not letting you putting your own music CapCut change it please.
User friendly and helped me achieve my vision!
So I tried to see if I had the new velocity button on style but I couldn’t see it so could you please make it show up because it did not show up for mine
Okay this app is great but really really really really really (9 years later) really really (702 really later) glitchy. That’s all.
So for the slow mo its so choppy so could you maybe fix it a make it smoother ?
"To begin with, I saw you put a new velocity edit overlay thing and I wanted to try it out. It wasn’t letting me do Styles or it didn’t show the velocity so I deleted it and updated it and it still didn’t show."
I use it for all my videos and its free its pretty good if you would ask me but it needs some upgrades
"it’s really easy to use and i really like it but there is a problem just recently it says i’m not connected to internet when i am, and i can use some of the effects. it’s super annoying."
So I was editing a video I made and I was trying to hit play and when I tried to hit play it would not play the video clip
This app is so good I can’t even explain how good it is just get it if you like editing
I liked this app despite some issues. I recommend it!
"I love the overlays and filters but, the text stopped working in the middle of me trying to work on my video. Not helpful at all."
It’s annoying me because I can’t finish my video so can you please fix this I can’t always finish my video because the app is so annoying please fix this issue so I can finish the video
"i try and try and try but I just can't get it to work i haven't even passed the first page because whenever I hit the ""confirm""  button it does not let me make a video"
The day I downloaded cap cut I did 14 videos 13 adopt me and 1 grain he’s a famous YouTuber and I wach him A lot this game is fun
The app in the it’s pretty good overall it’s just when I try to make a video it’s said storage full and I deleted it and re-uploaded it but it still says storage full
"I’m very happy with this app. I have been using it for a year now and have been able to make great things. There are a couple features I hope can be added. First of all we need to be able to add multiple animations to one clip. Currently I can’t fade in and then fade out the clip. I also can’t fade out a clip that has a fancier animation. I would love if i was able to favorite animations and apply the same animation to all clips. I would also like if the speed tool was better. Currently slowing down clips is very glitchy. Another suggestion is to add more font choices, especially ones similar to higher paying programs. It would be great if I could import fonts. You recently updated the camera focus effect and blur effect so that you can speed it up and add more blur but it’s still not the same. I would like for it to be able to look the same for shorter clips as I use that a lot. This way I can make edits that look more professional. I would like for me to be able to add multiple colors to the chroma key. I would like to be able to add multiple effects and animations to text and clips. And maybe something to improve the quality of my videos. Those are some of my recommendations. Some of the fonts show the fonts in another language. I would like for all of the fonts to be shown in the language i have set on the app or phone, for me English. My only other criticism is that it can be glitchy. Sometimes when I try to watch my video it pauses on a certain part and unfreezes later in the video. Although I do appreciate the lack of ads. In conclusion I do love this app. Please look at my suggestions I believe many people would benefit from them!!"
"This app is honestly great but it ate 17gbs in one month, 20gbs in 2 months, and 29gbs in only 3months i deleted it but im downloading it again"
This app helped me on editing. This app made me a better editor! THIS IS THE BEST EDITING APP!!!!
Every time I put in 1 photo I have to delete that video and create a new one
THIS APP IS GREAT FOR TIKTOKS AND EDITING! You may need a few tutorials but other than that I think this app is INCREDIBLY easy to use!!! ❤️😊
Can we get a premium for this this is a very very good app
I love the app but it doesn’t support Arabic language 🥲
Literally have every tools you ever need! Great for beginners.
Whenever i open this app and import photos/videos and then i want to add some effects it shows NO INTERNET CONNECTION why??? Please fix this ASAP may be other people also facing same problem ....THANK YOU
This app can annoying because it always says that my Storage is full like girl it’s not so that’s just so annoying and I can never make an edit like step up your game here! 🙄🙄🙄🙄

I love this app but since v3.4.0 and v3.5.0 auto captions are not working. And that was my primary reason for using the app.
I have deleted most of the carp off my iPhone can I just be able to upload what I want and download it with out a message saying that there’s too much clutter on my phone
I never knew how to make gacha vids without this this is a free app it is amazing and I suggested it !
When I updated it that’s when it started sucking. Freezing up non stop! Fix please. Love this app!

"Please add Arabic language to the app, Arabic is a famous language like another language"
whenever i like to edit i like to stabilize the edit but the stabilizing thing doesn’t do anything anymore sometimes deleting the app and re-downloading doesn’t help please fix this
I Really Love This App It Helps Me With My Edits Everything I Love How Everything Is For Free All The Other Apps Don’t Help But This One I Love ❤️
When I make edits and try to add transitions it just says no WiFi you need WiFi even though I already tried two different WiFi’s
This app has a lot of bugs that need to fixed and won't work if It doesn't have wifi even though I use my wifi it clams it still doesn't work.
I love this app everything is free no need to pay for anything!!! <3 🥺
this is amazing! i was just searching up an editing app and a by accident clicked on this and wooww couldnt ask for anything better! at first i was doubtful if it was free or not because it was too good to be true! totally recommend.
The style button is not showing up
Easy to use and understand.
"If yall have a patreon i'd support for more features. lol

please consider the following:

• Incremental numbers while resizing an overlay. (for consistency)

• being able to resize outside in the black void (for certain formats like 9:16)

amazing app, thank you. :)"
Where’s the velocity on style my CapCut is all updated i’ve had it before but all the sudden it’s gone now🤷🏻‍♀️
This is a very good app but mabye it needs some updates? Install in nowwwwwwwwwwww!
I like capcut it’s a free editing app I do tweening on gacha and post it on tiktok it’s a good app I recommend it
Thank you so much this is the best editing app ever
"App keeps crashing , certain videos wont play when I try to edit them  and everytime I try to edit all my videos it says cannot import"
"love this app. one of the best apps i’ve used. but y’all need to fix the export problem. and i know i’m not the only one. keeps crashing and yes i still got enough storage.
thanks"
This app was nice until it made the audio start glitching
I wish it was like VSP like the bounces and stuff but overall great
It’s good when you start but I have had it for a long time that’s how I still do edits all of them are gone now cause CapCut restarted my app and now they are all gone
I was just trying to edit a video when it kept on saying I wasn’t connected to the internet??? I was literally connected to WiFi and it still didn’t let me do anything
Hey I’m a beginner to capcut and am having some trouble understanding the app because I’m more comfortable with KineMaster but Capcut has some better effects so could I have some tips?
Ah yes well if it isn’t the app where I can make those Roblox stories
This is so sad how it just is always complicated to use CapCut which it should be easy for the younger kids are people out there but it’s not which it should be
everything about this app is just awesome but everytime i have a video i run out of over lays which then i have to use a different editing app so please add more
"its alright. sometimes it says “no photos found”
I don’t know what to do but it’s a good app :)"
It has a lot of cool affects and other things but it says that I need to clean up my storage but I’m deleting everything I can! >:(
Could you add better text animations😩 like where they look like the letter are glitching😴
"I hate to say this, but the new update has caused lots of problems including glitches that used to never happen…"
This is one of the best free editing app. I use this for TikTok and it’s been great so far
Everything is on point love it so much
the text to speech is not working I tried everything when I press it no voices come up for me to chose please fix this.
This would be a five star app if there were tutorials on how to actually operate it. Make them.
So it keeps telling to delete some phone storage and I did and I also deleted some iPad storage and it still won’t let me use capcut
I love this app sooo much but what makes me mad is it takes to much storage and it lags.
This app is the best because it doesn’t kick me out thank u
This app takes up to 7 gigabytes and it fills up your storage so for me I’m in between
I love CapCut but I want to change my background.
"Pretty good, easy to navigate, and easy to use. But, it never plays when I hit the button."
It’s easy to work with and overall just great. Lol.
overall this app is great but whenever i try to use any of the transitions and stuff it just says “no internet connection” but i am connected to internet. could i have help?
Ok 5 stars because it’s awesome and it helps me become a Gacha tuner also 1 question what do the numbers stand for under the project you made!????
This has no watermark. Download it it is good better then anything
I think I love this app so much bc of how easy it is to maneuver
"So at first I thought this was dumb to install but THIS IS AWESOME!! everything is free! This app is like after effects in mobile, THATS HOW FRICKING GOOD IT IS!!"
"I LOVE THIS APP I CANT STRESS IT ENOUGH. This app works beautifully, there are so many animations and effects to choose from."
okay i have used capcut for about 4-3 weeks and i have gotten so much love and hype from my edits on here. i recommend. but i also have a request! i would love if we could put keyframes on stickers and texts. thank you!!
where did the style button go? i was making an edit and i was gonna add “auto velocity” but then i realized my style button wasn’t there?? i thought it was a update but i don’t have any update options ☹️
I was going to edit and went to styles and the 3D effect wasn’t there anymore even on my old edits it was gone
"I like the app a lot, but it bugs when I cut audio off, its really annoying. I have to use a different app just for the audio because of this, I’m hoping you can fix this? Thank you!"
Best app ever ! No complaints coming from me .
i really like this new update but can u guys please fix it because whenever i use it i see a green glitch and it’s bothering me can u fix it please it will be so much better thanks
• Please fix where I can edit picture it bugs me!
"When I try to order my overlays, it keeps going back to it original place without me pressing undo. It’s giving me stress and I will be deleting"
"I use this to edit yt videos it’s really good, you should definitely get it!"
"Auto velocity isn’t on here for me and a lot of others,how can we fix this?"
"i was making a edit last night and i used auto velocity and i check this morning and the auto velocity option in style is gone? why did you guys remove it, it's an amazing feature that is very helpful, please add it back soon because i'd like to use the feature again for my edit"
It won’t let me use graphs it’s sooooo annoying! Please fix it
Hey CapCut so that update the slow-mo update yeah I updated and did not get it
Make Opacity Option for Texts Too
Anytime I close the app it keeps on deleting it please fix this!!!
"Hi!! I’m downloading this app on my new phone, this app is good no lies! I’m so happy to have this app, and the animation is really cool."
If that works it will be an amazing app
"It’s fun and all, nice effects, but literally- now I can’t edit at all. It needs access for my albums and stuff, I have it enabled and it doesn’t work?! Seriously."
This app is super useful and easy to use once u use it 24/7 😁
"Arabic typing still not working
Tiktok Songs not add or not loaded"
This app is the literal best. I finally found the right app for editing!
Ever since there has been graphs my key frames go somewhere else and it makes me wanna cry please fix this mistake!!!
I give it one star because it’s always laggy and when I’m somewhere else but my home and I have internet connection it doesn’t even work it’s like I have to stay home nd edit
"Might be my phone but idk
I was trying to edit a video with only 32vids and it just wouldn’t let me edit it! And it was so enjoying because it wouldn’t work please fix it:/"
"I really like the app, but I accidentally deleted it and it wont let me download it anymore!!!!!"
"okay so dont get me wrong i love capcut, its amazing, but i feel like there needs to be some more variety to the effects for example and the fonts, i would also very much appreciate if you removed the “insucnificent storage” message (idk how to spell it)"
I can’t get the new update?
"Dear Ppl. 

This app is so good (not a bot -.-) 
I use this for my tik too acc it super good for starters I really hope u will enjoy this!"
It lags when you download it
I think if the app adds more transitions or add graphs the app would be way better than it is. But other than that the app is amazing to play around with
So I was making an edit and I added my so7nd and st the starting you out it with this thing that doesn’t play the sound then plays it and it ruins the. Game fir me pls remove it pls pls pls it cwnt even shorten it pls remove it
It’s a great editing app but it takes up heaps of space.
U should add graphs btw and like more stuff like vid star and funimite but I love the app and it takes so much storage tho but yeah
It seems pretty good to make Emoji Stories! It got time to get used to but it seems great!
I love the app and love to edit on it but it lags so hard and I know it’s not my internet I’m at full on 4 bars Do better
It’s a really good app for a free price everything is free it’s amazing
I use this app for my yt channel and it’s the best. One problem it takes a lot of ur storage
"There is a problem in the Arabic language. We cannot write your application is very nice, but the Arab world complains about this problem"
"EVERYTHING is free no watermark, multiple layers, effects, transitions etc. I LOVE IT!!"
I have been using this app for years and it won’t let me do anything😬👩🏼‍🦲
It’s so good but after like a year or so my projects got deleted and my newest projects won’t save its so annoying.
Can we please add support for Spanish?
I never write reviews but this app compelled me to do so. Couldn’t be happier!
CapCut is a great editing app and it’s the first I’ve found with no watermark! No ads to!
I saw this all over tiktok and only used it for the sugar rush edit...
Sorry video star but this better
I LOVE THIS APP SO MUCH i can finally add overlays and there free and effects I always wanted to do on video star ! I love this app sooo much!❤️
"Video doesn’t export properly i app photos and watch export video its play for 2-3sec then just stuck and background music is still playing,sometimes its also fail to export."
"So Beautiful, Should You to Download the app!!"
"Best editing app I’ve seen in a while, apart from Avu"
Can you add a search bar?
it keeps saying I don’t have internet when I do!! pls help
It’s amazing even tho I’m not a good editor it’s still good
I used to use this app all the time- till one day it suddenly said “no connection” and I had full bars and full wifi. It’s been 2 weeks and it STILL says this. Fix this ASAP
"I like this app, my all tik tok videos are made by this app 🥹🔥"
"I cant use the auto velocity feature anymore, it’s not available. have you removed it? why? good app, but this is upsetting."
the app is amazing the best editing app i’ve used and i’ve been editing since 2016 however the app has been super glitchy and kicks me out of the app the project won’t save either can this bug be fixed please <3
this seems like a nice app and all but it doesn’t work for me. so i’ve updated the app and when i hit edit and then pressed style everything everyone else has isn’t up to date
"It works great so far I just got it but I’m really enjoying it, it works well!"
CapCut can u make the shake like video star🥺
"literally, it’s a great editing software.
I have nothing to say because it’s so good."
We all need it
capcut is really easy to use when making satire gacha videos but i can’t access my tik tok songs anymore after a few days of connecting my account.
"I Love this App, The effects are great my edits come out great but the things you should add are graphs and maybe trendy transitions?!?!?"
It’s a very good app and I would rate it a 10/10 in my opinion🌸🌼🌺🌷🌹💐
When I 1st got it I didn’t know how to use it is there something that can help me or show me how to use it I swear this is so hard! Pls just someone help me use it 💀
I like it but I wish there was more options to add overlays🙁 but overall love itt
capcut should let us make accounts so when we delete the app we can log back in and still have all out hard work

Please keep up the good work on this app
use to work really great and I thought it was the best. But for some reason my videos that I would import in it just showed a black screen
Please if you could make the slowing down smoother or add velocity and smooth slowing down thank you. Have a great dat
It’s but I have a problem It always say not enough storage
Every time I try to make a edit it always says to clean up some of my storage even though I always clean it it’s not fair I just wanna make videos I hate this app so much
"This app has many great features, but the lag and crashing is simply too much. Fix the lag"
"Hi so i use CapCut for my videos and I really like The app but…
This is been going on for a while it’s a very STUPID PROBLEM SO I NEED TO PUT IN 5 OVERLAYS BUT EVERY TIME IT SAYS I HAVE NO FLIPPING PHOTOS! AND I KNOW IT’S NOT JUST THE IPAD BECAUSE NONE OF MY OTHER EDITING APPS DON’T DO THAT!
PLEASE PLEASE FIX THIS IT MAKES MY EYES WATER BECAUSE I’VE MESSED UP THIS VIDEO 4 TIMES EVERY TIME IT’S DOING THAT! AND IT’S MAKING ME CRY! PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!"
"It’s a great. The reason I’m given it 4 stars
Just A suggestion. It needs a chroma key added to the overlay."
You don't have to pay and it's just so good
There’s just so many good editing features for free!!!
"y’all should really download bro, I be on here editing 25/8 awesome app and works good"
"This is a very good app I love the effects and it helps with gacha life videos, this is the best app I had so far!"
The app doesn’t support Arabic text. When you add Arabic text it shows the letters only but are not connected. Do you have plans to resolve this issue?
I just cant do things related to internet even my wifi speed is too good fix this 😒
When ever I try to post something with 110m bits it's does not work it always everyday says not enough storage when I literally have 0 photos FIX YOUR APP.
I have TONS of fun making anime edits for my fans and tweeking stuff with the help of pics art it’s amazing 10/10
"There are watermarks, and I downloaded the app for a few specific edits but they took them out?! I don’t know why but I’m uninstalling the app not good just get iMovie instead it’s so much better"
The app is great this is the best app for editing but please add moving frames. Like the moving frames in anime edits
It's good and all but it won't let me click the overlays and other stuff
I love this app so much. It’s so underrated and needs more love and attention.
I love it but the thing is that I cannot do velocity and I still love it but we’re is it
very upset that the style option is gone.. PLEASE BRING IT BACK
Good app But They removed the styles BOTTON Now I dont know What to do that was how I made my edits And now I can’t
Style option is not showing up even after re downloading it multiple times
"Im a beginner editor who was thankful for auto velocity, but it’s gone now and my edits just look off."
"I like capcut, great app!! But I just know a lot of capcut editors would LOVE it if we could adjust the speed of our velocity!! PLEASE ADD THIS😍"
really good editing software but can you guys make it so users can import audio from files not just from camera roll
I don’t actually
It’s a good app for people who don’t know how to edit and who are broke and wants a good editing software for free
"ok so i love capcut. been using it for about a year. but the problem is: glitches. glitches are just audio not working, screen upside down, exedra exedra. but great app! easy to use and totally free."
"I love this app because it is so good and simple and not to mention, its free!"
It always says I have to much storage or something like that and it’s so annoying
The app is terrible don’t get it!!!! I was so happy about the new effect when suddenly I came back it was gone so if u get the app effects might disappear and it lags I updated etc.. still no good
I don't have it so I'm so confused everyone else has it so we're is it I look everywhere and don't see it
So when I got CapCut it was pretty bad but now it has VELOCITY and it is so crazy!
"but this app is seriously incredible my favorite editing app by far its easy, there’s amazing features, free, great transitions/options, everything about this app is chefs kiss :)"
It won’t stop saying “No internet” when I have it 🤯🔫
Im happy when i started but with then it seems to be off becuase it keep saying there no photos but i do have photos
I just made a whole bussy throbbing volocity edit 😩😩
So there’s this cool video editor called vlog star you should get it
It’s good but it says insufficient storage even tho I emptied all of my storage and that popped up I’ll show you proof
"It kept saying i have no internet connection even if i do, i really wanna see how it is but i never get to! Please fix this if you can, its really annoying."
I love that everything's free and easy but you cant do to mush with it
"Wen I need editing some Videos I Don’t find  
languish Arabia (like any app video editing)
way You Don’t spurts"
"This app is FREAKIN amazing it lets me edit anything videos,pictures and Marie I would purple this for edits! YASS"
is an amazing app but when try to make a video it says too much storage so i delete some photos and then it says not enough memory but still a great app pls change it
Been using this for months now and I love this!! I forgot to write a review😅I love it because it's free no subscription LOVE IT KEEP SHINING CAP CUT.
Very bad now it may be y to learn to use but when you learn it you realize you can’t do a whole lot there is little to no optimization and it in all a bad app won’t use again
I made edits on TikTok is really amazing my TikTok is animetooken if you want to see my edits from this app!
BEST APP EVERRRR!!!!! I just started learning how to edit videos and it’s soooo easy to do so with this app. I even use it for school. Love it
It has really good functions but the app itself is not good at all. It keeps saying memory is full or it’s unable to upload
"I have been using CapCut for a while and it’s a really great editing app. But, in the last couple of days it says that I don’t have internet connection when I am 100 percent sure I do."
This app is amazing for making edits for fan pages on tiktok love this app so much not evening joking
"Amazing, fantastic, great, beautiful. Capcut is my best friend. So easy to use, the features are so neat, amazing app bros."
"This app cuts my hair off in every photo or makes me really blurry in the 3D mode but not white friends, please work on your app. There are more than just white people out there"
I love CapCut but can they add a bit more animations in Combos and more stickers ?
It’s A Great App For Editing My Videos But The Storage Is Stupid Crazy I Only Had 3 Videos And It Said No More Storage So If You Cloud Fix That It Would Be Fine
"so it’s great! But the WiFi keeps going out and each time I delete it it turns on and I feel like the app is turning off my wifi, but it is still great but if this happens again I’m reporting the app."
"I absolutely loved CapCut until it stopped working one day, now I can’t even add animation, filters, texts, or anything else. It says “No Internet Connection”

Please fix"
By having good edits and no watermarks made me rate this app and I barely even rate
It’s SOO good I edit it on it a lot but I think it should have a little slomo
"I used this app for tik tok,I am a Roblox vloger and I needed a lot of apps for editing and, so far this is the BEST ONE"
"I really liked the style update for the auto Velocity, but I just updated my CapCut and its not there"
I just do not like the app
"First off it deleted one of my edits that took 5 hours to make I cried for hours after that, but I will give some credit it is pretty easy to use and it’s fun :)"
"i mean u can make edit without problems and they have so much transition choices, also it’s free - no ads - what more could i ask for! unlike vivacut and those money fishing apps"
Thank you for bringing styles back
I’ve been trying to contact the developer or anyone with the company in regards to the “STYLE” option. It completely disappeared and no one has responded. Very displeased. Erasing the app and letting others know as well.
The only reason I downloaded the app was for that and know I can’t use it what’s happening
I just want to saw that WHY DID YOU REMOVE IT! it was the best thing because it was a really good thing you guys added 😭.
How come I upgrade my CapCut and didn’t get the new features?
I had multiple finished edits and some of them included audio from the clips themselves. Now when I play the edits the video audio won’t play but the music I added. I am very disappointed!
I love this app! It helps me make videos and edits for my channel!
"Works very well for beginner editors, the TikTok audio section seems to be broken"
This app is good but it won’t let me import videos. I hate this so much! It also says I have no internet but I do. I don’t get it! pls fix this
I keep trying to make a TikTok edit but every time I go to original sounds on TikTok it says I have no internet connection even tho I do like what 😡
"Best editing app ever! Really easy to figure out, no ads, and free."
"i honestly love capcut , its the only app i learnt to edit on really fast. but there are 2 things that are just annoying. like how much it lags when you add a few clips and their short, and the slomo is very laggy. thats all."
Can yall  add new transitions and better camera shakes not to crazy
I’m glad this is free and helpful. Best editing app of all time!
"I logged into my TikTok on the CapCut thing so I could have my sounds, when I favorited a new sound it never loaded! And it doesn’t allow me to log out! This is terrible service"
I wanna know who made this app it’s perfect
It’s so laggy and it needs improvement
Every time I’m animating and I have like 3 layers my overlays start moving by themselves I even bought a new phone and it still does it
I give this a one star because nothing works and it does not let me post but I had to wait two days for me to post it looks good but the graphics is so fake so I give this a one star
Everything glitches nothing placed right sounds always black out effects glitches going in the wrong place
"This app is perfect no glitch no bug and no problem everything free , all features perfect. I LOVE THIS APP 
Ty capcut"
Love it helps me with gacha and roblox edit keep it up
It’s free and it’s easy and understanding to use
Get it get it get it!!! No complaints from me! I’m a happy customer !!
Capcut is a very good editing app for TikTok and other stuff you can even do TikTok trend on it.
"Says internet issue when it’s clearly working on everything else… I love this app but, it won’t let me use any features now due to internet issue!!"
I love it so much!it is very easy to do
I wish this app was on Microsoft hopefully the creators of capcut can read this
I love it simple and easy to use for good aesthetic edits
It’s a good but it needs Spanish
I hate you I hate you I hate you All the effects are great but it’s been really glitchy for no reason and now I can’t even make my edits what’s the point fix it fix it now😐
"No watermark, no ads, and no limits on anything. It’s perfect."
I recommend
"Just an amazing app, everything is good about this app, love the transitions and the animations 😻"
It’s pretty good but when I want to make a video it says I have a lot of storage I only have one app and 1 vid
I used to edit on video star (free) but i got capcut and all transitions were amazing the cube transitions is totally FREE
Deleted style
"I love this so much! No ads! Everything is free! So many cool animations! Best thing ever, i will ONLY use this app! Also NO WATERMARK!!! SUPER EASY TO USE!!"
"it's great, and while im typing this out all of capcut's features are free :D"
SOOO much effects and all for free! It’s all we want 🥴 good job! Love this app
"Omg this game is the best I use it 
For every one of my yt vids pls get this app it's amazing! 😍😍😍"
I love this app. It has such good editing tools. Seriously download this app everyone!
I have a little problem but most of it is ok i can’t email bc I’m a kid so idk it won’t let me update the app I keep checking for it but nothing happens
I have deleted almost everything in my camera roll and all my apps and it still won’t let me download a 480P video you need to fix this
It’s and and lot’s of updates now!
Really good editing app.
It good though
Love this app so much
Love it is was great I did a lot with it
"capcut is great it’s just the BUGS. Capcut for me keeps saying “capcut requires access” 
WHAT DO U MEAN
PLZ FIX"
This app is really great by 7gb? That’s a whole lotta storage. I might redownload but the way my storage is rn it’s suffering.
The app is amazing but the storage is the only problem
So I love this app! It just won’t let me update:(.
It’s an amazing app and I’m so happy I don’t have  to pay… but it would be nice if you could add a smooth slow-motion and graphs
"This app doesn’t have as good transitions, but it’s really good.🙂"
It’s a very good for beginners but I have winged of and download alight Motion but I love capcut for my overlays and the transitions.
It’s pretty difficult at first but I got the hang of it. Overall 4/5
It’s a real good app I like that it’s free but can u please add graphs and shakes and velocity it’ll be able to be considered a real editing app
3 out of 4
Anyways i love this app and why r yall saying so much in one comment??-
I love this app so much but I would like it more if you added graphs 🙂.
The app is good but it’s Storage is lying I have more then enough but it still say I don’t
.
sooo when I tried to edit my yt video it wouldn’t let me save it because whatever it was and it should let me save it🙄
:((((
"It says I have too much storage when I have 3 apps, 5 photos and 1 video! Dude! I left it as my only app, deleted every photo and video, AND YET it STILL says my storage is full when I haven’t even done ANYTHING on capcut! Don’t get this app 😡😡😡"
Hi I am a capcut editor and I love capcut I’ve been using it for so long now but one thing is I don’t like when u need storage for it
Cap cut is great but it will not let me edit I have to delete everything I have to make it work it’s not letting me do any thing
"This game is very fun but it would not let me make a video so I deleted it and right after tried to download it, and it’s bin trying to download for 2 days WHY CANT I DOWNLOAD IT!!"
"I love it, but the fact that it keeps saying I need to clean my storage is horrible. I recommend you fix it!"
When ever I use it and I delete all my photos it says clear up some space even tho I try making 5:50  long videos and nothing is in my storage
In all the videos I edit there is always a delay
I love the app but I just got to figure out how to use it properly
So my storage is full and they want me to get rid of my stuff No I’m not doing it there my favorite stuff like take the storage thing away like it ruins the app
This is a the bomb!!!!! I love it and I do all my edits on it!!!! Get this app! It’s really good and easy to edit!!!! ‼️❤️❤️⚠️⚠️
there are tiny things that could be fixed but overall this app is great. but when i save videos there seems to be delay in the video from the audio.
Can you fix the then and now transition?
Great app but it only lets u save 15 minutes of videos that bad for YouTubers who wants longer videos
I do love this app but at times filter stops
U guys got rid of the style button with the new update that was the only reason I used cap cut buts now it’s gone
I literally just used this thing yesterday and I can’t find the style feature so that I can use the auto velocity
They remove auto velocity
I’ve been using style for pics on CapCut but where is it it’s gone all of a sudden CapCut if your hearing this put it back on the APP cause I was just using this today so hurry it up now
I cant download the app again!😭 Its so annoying pls help!
The app has just been loading in the App Store and not letting me download it
It’s free and easy alThough takes time to learn 🤗
CapCut overlays are moving on there own and it’s  glitches very now and then please fix this bug
This app is horrible every time I try to get a song on my video it says no internet and it won’t put the music don’t download! Also the projects won’t save
Download this app its so good try it out you will love it!!!
This app is hard to use and I often get frustrated when using it it’s a good app but there could be some changes to make it better and easier.
I try to make videos and it says my storage is full no matter how hard I try it won’t work goodbye Calcutta im going to find a new one until this is fixed
it’s so fun and gives you 1 mil likes and 10 mil followers!<3 stan CapCut(made by TikTok)
So good never seen better I want a cat now
"It’s a very good app when your lazy and you want an edit, but every time I split a clip and I want a smooth slomo (the slomo is terrible) I put on unreal2 and it flashes when I don’t want it to. Help"
I love this app! But the only problem is that I will have no projects and CapCut will say I have to many projects.
I love this app so much words cannot describe how much I love it!
I really like this app but if there was a MacBook version I fell it would be better
"my videos lag everytime i play it back. at first it was fine because it never shows up when i save it, but now i can't even finish them because the sound cuts off and it glitches. this app is the only way for me to make edits. there was just a recent update, people have been experiencing this problem for weeks. fix it"
This is great for beginners! It’s super easy! I love it so much! But......... I need storage to do edits! I still love it!
I was very happy with this app till i flund out that they deleted all my videos i made so the emoji gc is gone my intro is gone my videos my photos gone delting the app very very very bad i hate it!
This is a great app for editors and Gacha tubers who’d own have access to VIDEOSTAR due to it needing to be bought but I definitely suggest this for Gacha tubers!!
I had about 7 yt videos that I was supposed to post on friday but I go back to open the app and nothing is there please don’t download this it will just take up space
I love this app bc it help’s me with edit’s for my Tiktok video’s
Honestly capcut is overall bad mostly because when i need to do small things and i cut it smaller i cant even click on it because the stupid plus signs are there
The slow motion in your app is too laggy and choppy and can you please fix that I’m trying to make good edits that are smooth so thank you and bye <3
I love cap cut but to hard to edit
How do I use the new 3D update it’s not there I need help please
I think this app is amazing you should get it
I would’ve definitely given it 5 stars if they hadn’t removed the “Moon Off” effect... add it back 😕😐
I love it it have so much to do that’s all
"Just- Amazing. Incredible app, and the best editing video app ever."
the app has been really glitchy and I can’t do my edits because it freezes can you guys fix that?
It says my storage is low when I’ve deleted HUNDREDS of videos
Hey! Could you please make some more animations and make them more better and not the same
"It started to get really laggy and wouldnt let you add texts sometimes, its honestly pretty good for effects, BUT THE WEIRD TEXT AND STICKER GLITCH. But its pretty good so I recommend."
"Please make it so I can save my edited videos longer than 15 minutes, other than that, it’s great."
I like the app it’s easy to use and it’s fun but  it would be great if it had motion blur:D
This is a very professional editing app.
I don’t have a lot to say but I made so many videos
"guys please i love ur app i just i need to velocity edit but i cant w out the style option😭 it literally just disappeared?? please cap cut gods
fix this i dont know how much longer i can go without cap cut."
I’ve been looking for the style button for 30 minutes to realize that it’s not even here anymore. Why the heck did you remove it .-.
Did the developer take away the style option ? That used to be my favorite toool to use with this app. Bring it back please!
"i wanna talk with crop, capcut is an amazing editing app and all but cropping photos is really hard u cant make it thin or fat so i wanna add easy cropping so everyone can crop right,not by installing pics art and that stuff so it would really help if you add crop"
It’s a amazing beginning app!! You should download
good but my capcut doesn’t have the new velocity update. I’ve updated the app twice and still now success. Any ideas?
They removed some effects that I loved to use. I will give 5 stars when they add them back.
Its a great app and i love it but when i use graphs it messes up my movements ive added
Never got my updates. When they said smooth slow mo today…IT SAID OPEN BUTTON! Not Update!! Same with dynamic
It’s a good app but when it got a new update it started glitching please fix ty
"ITS SOOOO AMAZING so at first, kinemaster got me...theni heard about this app and its AMAZING! Nothing bad about it at all! Have a nice day btw!❤️🦋"
"You need to pay now that’s stupid and my phone is an IPhone and it’s charging it ?! 
CapCut is really stupid for doing that 🙄and I used to have it and when I want to re download it this happens 🙄"
There is a glitch where a video is to long so it won’t export
I LOVE CAPCUT ITS SOO GOOD. But i wish they had a computer application. if it did this amazing app would’ve had a five star.
"sometimes it crashes, and sometimes when i try to import a photo it says i have none, but the worst is how it deleted something i worked on for 7 hours, i didnt do anything. i had no confirmation. i gave this 1 extra star for when it actually works which is very rare!"
You can’t be walking around without giving IOS graphs too...
This app is very nice. It’s like a magic of editing. But Arabic language support is missing. I think it’s time to support Arabic fonts. 🌷
:)
I love cutcap but it’s to much cuz when I try to do a video and it says to much Storage on this iPhone I be mad cuz I deleted everything in my phone and it’s need to get fixed
"i was glad to come across capcut because i wanted to become an editor but i had to pay for alot of the apps, so when i found capcut i was so excited!!"
I cleared my storage I have storage and capcut won’t let me edit saying lOw StOrAgE I have storage and I’m thinking of quitting capcut cause this is just annoying
I’ve offloaded and deleted so many things and it still says thag i have inCuFfINecejtm stOrAgE.. fix that
"Everything on this platform is great, but the speed is so choppy. I suggest you make slower speeds smoother for editors."
I hope it supports the Arabic language
"this is a good editing app! but today, i tried making an edit for my inteo im doing for my series. but it said my storage is full EVERYTIME. WHY DO I NEED STORAGE JUST TO EDIT? PLEASE FIZ THIS ITS MAKING ME SUPER ANGRY."
Great app until the auto captions stopped working and now i cant make the videos i wanna make
"I wanted to do the trend thing with the 3D zoom but I don’t even have the styles options, it says the app is updated yet I don’t have it"
"It says I have too much storage tho my Icloud barley has anything I can’t tell if its apple or Capcut, if it’s capcut please change it I just want to edit videos"
I really do love the app and it’s really good. But it be cooler if it has a pc version.
Ok
Literally perfect for editing in every way at no cost ! 🥰
"if i could rate this higher than five stars, i would
how is this free????
i'm obsessed
apps like Videostar and CuteCut could NEVERRR
the amount of effects and transitions are mind blowing. 
did i mention it's all FREE
i will die with this app
💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕"
I like it only that it ends up getting so laggy Like I can’t edit anything like that It’s so slow when I try to trim the videos
It may seem like a good app and have such good reviews but it’s very Sketchy and it messes up ur whole phone I wouldn’t recommend this app at all there so many things that are wrong for with this app
Don’t start charging to use this lol
I think its the best and I’ve made memories on it
Bro we need style back I can’t do my velocity no more 😭I need it back please!!!!!
I love this app and it is so good but I didn’t get all of my updates
I hade this game but I don’t like it well I do it’s just when I get into the app I have to wait 5 seconds when I add a pic I have to wait 3 seconds for it too add
I update my Capcut app and now I can’t find the shortcuts option to edit video
For some reason the audio is really delayed and i don’t know why and i don’t know if this is happening to other people.
This app at app store it says ，we have mandarin chinese ，but it is only has Tanwanese，please translate it，thanks🙏🙏🙏
I don’t know why but the app has been bugging pretty bad lately. I’ve used capcut since last year and I’ve never had a problem. Capcut keeps lagging/glitching and it’s bugging me.
Why did you  remove the effects?-
I love this app but please get the electric light broader back again!!!!
You should add smooth slowmo:)
"i don’t have the new feature where you get velocity. the apps fully updated, but i don’t have the new feature at all."
It’s kinda it’s just tell me that I full of storage but I’m not so it’s getting very annoying
When I updated it I didn’t have the velocity or any other new updates  it looks the same as before?
It was amazing but took up space
Get “no Internet connection” everytime! Shouldn’t have to delete and download over and over!
"Okay. So, I was trying to upload a video, but it wouldn’t let me. So I restarted the app, AND GUESS WHAT? ALL MY EDITS WERE GONE..EVEN MY FAVS, And my hard work paid off for NOTHING. So that is the reason why I gave a 1. 😭😭

PS. give my edits back now. and I’ll forgive.."
CapCut is drunk. I’ve deleted over 2 GB of storage and the project is not even a GB and it still says insufficient storage.
Keeps saying no internet connection and I clearly have it.
Ok so I really like the app it’s cool and I’m a new editor it’s really fun but it’s annoying i rather use kin master and I HATE IT 😃 THIS NEEDS TO BE BETTER AND HAVE MORE STORAGE IF I DIDNT HAVE THE GRAPHS AND STROBE EFFECT I WOULD GIVE IT A 1 STAR DO BETTER NEXT TIME.
The App keeps crashing and then It deleted all my projects that I’ve been working on for five months already
When I add a image it would not even print in the video this app is broken
Hi cap cut team . You guys are great. But I can’t save a longer video clips . Can you guys fix that pls
Kindly add persian support font in new version
i accidentally deleted one of my videos and now i cant get them back. may you add a feature where you can get your deleted videos back? thanks
I think the app is kinda annoying because of the storage I delete a lot of apps just for it to say storage is full so don’t waste your time on this app
This app is amazing! But why those it keep saying i have no storage yet i have plenty
It’s a good app but one thing is the trim effect it doesn’t work.
It’s amazing! I have no problems😊 definitely a 5 star review😜
This app is free and perfect for my cooking videos!
So my voice effect does not work it glitches out and it sounds like my voice is vibrating so CapCut can u did that thanks
It’s free and it has the best features. Please keep it free!
You guys should add graphs it would make out edits way more smoother so please add those and ill ly:))
Its pretty good in general although when you go to style it dosent load and when you wanna add ⏃ photo you have to refresh overall its good
I made a lot of vids on here and today I started to cry because every this was GONE
"I can’t create anything g without it saying I don’t have enough storage! It’s infuriating! I deleted half of my photos and three of my apps and still, it doesn’t work. Worst app ever."
Every time I enter it works but then when I want to add a transistor or template or text it’s tells me you have no enternet even when I do have internet
"i was wondering if it was possible for you guys to make it possible to recover videos, like after you delete a video you can recover it within 7 days!"
"Es la mejor Aplicacion Que he descargado y usado totalmente gratis …

English :
It is the best Application that I have downloaded and used totally free…"
I love this app but it takes up all of my storage 😭🖐
This is the best editing app I’ve ever used I love it so much it’s amazing download it now👍👍💅💅💅
The animations/transition aren’t good I try to do edits on there but I can’t do it well cause the animations are not to good
I love it but I just got a MacBook and found out you guys don’t have support for macs yet!
It’s a really good editing app and it’s really simple 100% 5star
I was making a video and I couldn’t add anymore overlays because it says “Max overlay streams reached” it’s really annoying and the more it happens I’ll delete the app and get another
"Ok i am in love with this app I use it bc I have a Fanpage for,charli Damileo and this is what helps me post! Ty to the creator!"
So I don’t have swing :( I am trying to edit something and I don’t have swing
I deleted almost all my apps and a lot of my photos and yet still could not post my fricken video so ya why does it take my storage IDK
Plz make it optimize Arabic keyboard language ..thanks
I make a lot of anime edits so I have a lot of friends who do it to .
"i love capcut, it’s easy to edit and make videos, though i think it’d be cool if we were able to add gifs, like our own gifs, without making it into a plain and still image. anyways that’s all. bye"
Every thing is perfect just add Arabic Nastaliq fonts 🥰
Tbh this app is sooooo good for editing and easy!! You need to download it!
I’ve been trying to edit a video for the last 20 mins then I import my video in it shows my video as a black screen.
Capcut is a really fun cool app I love it so much and it is so easy to do it and I love it so much
I think CapCut is the best free editing app however it’s glitching so much after I had some effects.
"This app is the worst, I spent an hour on an edit and when I went out I couldn’t edit the video anymore, it froze my app and I tried restarting my device."
You dont need payments for any features and I love it sm!!
I really like the app but it’s say need “ Wi-Fi to turn on” and I checked and it’s on and I have fast WiFi’s that’s what’s wrong with my if you could something about it; it would mean a lot me thank you 😊
i like making edits but having to pay so much money just for simple transitions on most apps is horrible. i live this app and how it’s free. well done.
"Can you add loop animations to overlays,I want to use the wave tool o make my oc’s hair sway🥺"
Just downloaded this app and I’m already disappointed. The longest video I can upload is 4 seconds...
I would like be slow-mo if possible.
Thanks for making this completely free
THSI app is very sexy it’s so great at everything y’all should rate a 5! Star
I cant play my music while working on projects. :(
Not really sure as to why they chose to get rid of styles and auto velocity. it was the whole reason i got the app to start editing and they took it away.
I’ll change my review once y’all bring back style and auto velocity🤪🙄
"My style button just randomly disappeared. I tried updating the app, then deleting and downloading the app again, but it’s still gone."
this app is great but give me dark mode pls my eyes are blinded by light mode 😟
"This  app is unacceptable. I tried using it, but when I pressed the plus to make a video, it said “not enough storage” which got me mad. And also there is lots of lags."
It always says influential storage free up some room and I only made one video on CapCut and have a lot of storage space on my iPad
Amazing App I use video star but capcut is honestly a really good app 👍👍
"when i was going to finish one of my edits all of my drafts were gone and i worked so hard on the edits,FIX UR APP!!"
I used this on tiktok the normal one got 5 views and the edited got 1.2 millon views
I did my first edit ever and with 3 flicks it looks like the greatest this ever
So I was about to make a edit and it’s saying oh allow yiu photos already did and it won’t work SK PLEASE FIX NOW!!!!!!
It’s good but if u delete it and download it again u will not have nothing
This app is trash I deleted over 55 photos and still says I can't make a video because of storage I rather use tempo and idk y tiktok  sponsor u
"Too much storage!! It takes up a TON of storage, but a great editing app! ADD MORE BETTER SLO MO"
So while I was editing for tiktok I was doing good had about 24 edits on there and all of a sudden it kicks me out the app and deleted all my projects that I took a hour of my life on I am completely frustrated
From what I saw I thought this app was going to be helpful but ended up not even working I would hit a button to edit like any other editor app but nothing
I love the app its free and amazing to edit with ! Just that some transitions are a bit stiff. Overral very good editing app. 4/5
"Its all great  idk how but now when i split audio , the second part doesnt play , fix this please , i have better workflow with capcut so fix it fast"
The app is great it’s like a free version of video star it would be even better if it had graphs
Was editing a video for my TikTok account and I was finished so I TRIED to upload it but it said I need to free some storage AND I ONKY HAVE 5 APPS AND 7 VIDEOS AND 10 PHOTOS. this need an update 😒
The app is great but we want a full support for Arabic language pls
"There are many problems but love the app, when I do slo mos and velos it kicks me out :/"
It keeps telling me to delete more apps and I only have like 6 apps left :|
it’s an amazing app to edit i give this a 5 star it’s just amazing!!!! :D
"CapCut, may you add graphs and motion blur so my edit can look good? The app is still nice for editing but we NEED graphs and motion blur!!!! Thank you 😎"
Overall amazing app I have made a few edits and I love this it doesn’t crash like the other editing apps this is truly amazing!
I ain’t got no freaking cash
I’m annoyed at this I have nothing in my phone and it says I don’t have enough storage🙄🧐
????
First I can’t put new pictures and videos so how do I do it bc it’s bad
Theres a lot of affect but we need moreeeeee that app is amazing btw
Easy editimg
So I love this app but it said I can’t edit until I clean storage I got rid of 134 items yet it would work
This app is awesome and it’s free I can’t tell what can be wrong with this app it’s awesome!!!!
I had this app for a long time it help me with my edits!❤️
"Hilight：
Works very fast with 4K video
Endless effects
Easy to share and export final videos

Issues：
Can not import from other app but only from camera gallery；
Project file cannot be exported and synced with iCloud"
"every time i try to make a edit i try putting videos and it says “couldn’t import. try again.” my space is not full, if this is fixed it’s a 5 star"
"So, I was very pleased with capcut but the thing is in one updates they took STYLE OFF AND I CAME TO SAY TO CAPCUT YOU BETTER PUT IT BACK. Anyways 🤪 yea it’s a good app"
"This app is AWESOME when using it for edits
Like fan edits or just personal edit, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APP FOR ANYBODY WHO LIKES TO MAKE EDITS OR WHO IS A YOUTUBER!!"
"i mean it’s good in all, but it always says full storage when i literally deleted so much! and my storage isn’t even full! and i also feel it needs some new animations! thank u for ur time <3"
I love CapCut and I use it to edit but where the heck is style??
Put a water mark please
I make all my videos with CapCut!
How to do auto velocity? It no show up
The words I type in Myanmar Unicode fonts are not correct in your app.
"I love it, it makes good edits and its great for beginner editors like me. And all the stuff is free!😆"
This app is amazing I use it for like EVERYTHING idk what else to so bye!
i have to keep deleting and reinstalling the app because it wont let me use tiktok audios after i make one video. it just says reconnect to internet when i’m already on the internet smh
So I have had this app for a long time on my IPAD and today I redownloded it and it doesn’t work for my iPad anymore thanks a lot capcut
It was working for awhile then it try to edit something just straight black and so I restart it nothing then I uninstall it and now I can’t reinstall it for some reason
"I try to export a video and it crashes, please update this"
That shotcut feature is the best I’ve ever seen
"this app is amazing! It is so easy and good, also very good for beginningers"
i wish they could add this to pc it would be amazing using high end pcs to edit simple videos in high resolution with this app
It’s great and all but the texts are so annoying how they can only have one animation!!
I tried to get it and it would not let me download a video and It deleted everything I have created witch was only a few things
Can you make the transitions better cause I’m tryna make better edits and YAlL translations are bad 😭✋🏽
"If you need an editing app,this one is great it helped me a lot"
this all is really nice but if you are trying to edit small pieces of footage you really can’t because of your fingers. so i suggest making a computer version
Some suggestions I have for Capcut are to make the slo mo smoother it’s very rough and doesn’t look good
It’s very good! 10/10 would use.
"It was a good app until it stopped uploading. This is a problem for me. It’s just annoying and I deleted it. If you know how to fix this, tell me."
It keeps on telling me to free up space but I did that
Literally this app like no i installed it and its still loading like what?? its been like that for a week and no its not my phone
App is a amazing ! Can you please just add velocity with the flash ?
The slomo is very choppy but this is the best app I’ve ever used
"Hello CapCut devs, my iPad has been lagging with CapCut, in and outside the app. Can you fix that ? Thank you !"
I’m a youtuber I like using this app to edit but It takes away all your storage
This is probably one of the best free editing apps I’ve ever used! I BEG YOU PLEASE DONT UPDATE IT AND MAKE US PAY FOR CERTAIN THINGS!
This app is freakin awesome. So easy to use and actually works great.
This app is pretty good. Just add key frames as an option.
One day I was board then I downloaded it and I got good
"ok so, i love this so far! i just got it today and it’s working perfectly fine. it’s simple to load, not laggy at all and there’s so many effects, it’s amazing! ⚡️"
"I love this app so much, I can do amazing edits with it and FOR FREE!! I love it and recommend it 100%💜"
"The app is good and all, but why couldn’t they have added more animations such as “rotate left” or “rotate right”"
Everytime i open the app and edit it always says no Inter but I have internet and it’s working
Bring auto velocity back!!
That’s app is amazing the best app I ever see thanks for you helping!.
It’s a really good editing app but I wish you could take photos on the app
I use this for all my vids!
So this is a good app and all but WHY HAVE GREEN SCREEN IF YOU CANT USE IT ON OVERLAYS I think you used to be able to but you can’t now also it’s called chroma key
put the style option BACK BRUH
My tiktok favorite sounds aren’t working!!!
Please fix the reverse option it always says try again and my text is delayed after I import my videos
There is no probemlos! I love this app!
any time i try to export any video it only saves the first frame for the whole video. it’s really annoying and there’s so many more glitches that aren’t getting fixed because you’re only adding more things instead of fixing the broken features.
These notifications aren’t helpful in any sense and way too annoying. It even gets personal sometimes; so insensitive.
"so i an editor am really happy that this app is free and all, but what i really find annoying is that you can make velocity but not smooth slomo? maybe you are still working on that part but its so hard to find twixtored packs as a capcut editor. please make the slomo smooth"
Hello I love the app but can you update the app for the slowmo to be smooth?
I love how you make us do neon colors and velocity’s on it
I just want to say I love u guys
"This app is so good for it to be free, COMPLETELY FREE. Thx for making such a simple editing app."
It not working and it’s getting annoying
Amazing app! Only suggestion is to add more transitions and maybe graphs.
First of all the app told me I was not connected to the internet when I was then I was not allowed to use effects and it was horrible no thank you
"When I want to write in Arabic on a video, the letters do not combine to form an Arabic word, please fix the bug"
It keeps freezing up. But that’s about it.
ok so its good app in general but when i make edits on there it comes out offbeat when in the app it’s perfectly fine. also.. PLEASE ADD GRAPHS
"It’s good I can make good edits but it’s not letting me add a picture, and it uses waaay to much storage. I don’t even download anything and it says “to much storage” CapCut pleaseee fix this!"
I would rate 5 stars but this is annoying and I’m in USA
It is so fun and nice and all the  things on it is great 😊  10/10 ❤️
It’s good but I can’t re install the app
"I LOVE editing with this amazing no watermark, good transitions BUT I would love some new effects such as white noise."
MISS GURL ok ok don’t make me delete photos that I want in my camera roll ok because I delete about 900 and the storge is still full😟🤨🤷🏻‍♀️🧍‍♀️
I love this app but I recommend a wave for outros for kpop editor!!
Don't Get Me Wrong This App Is Awesome But One Thing This App Lags A Bit Some Times...
"Hello, so I was trying to make a edit on CapCut and basically I made a edit with this video and than I wanted to use it again but the same transitions were on it so please fix your app k bye"
It’s amazing! Just the text can only be used on cover for me and I compleat hate it! Other wise love the app
Whenever I use chroma key it gets stuck in the place and I never can use it when I do it for a hour it starts moving please fix this
It’s the best app ever you should try it i love editing!!!!!
OK so basicallyI am obsessed with app… I have made like a million edits Haha.... And i’m serious you need to get this app!!!!
"Yes. Get this. 
No ads
No money needed
No premium as far as I can tell
No lag
Always saves your work

BUT
(This is not creators fault or anything)
It does take a lot of storage. Not the app size, but the docs and data.

TY FOR REEEEEAAADING"
"This app is overall a great app, BUT every time i try to add an effect it says ""No internet connection, try again"" and I'm clearly connected to the internet."
"Where is it Pls help
Me"
"I love this app
But I’ve removed that and when I’m downloading again that want to take me money"
Hi I’m one of your guys users and I just wanna say thank u and also I am a little upset about you guys taking auto velocity edit off and style
This game is good except for when I need to add overlays I can’t add more then five but that’s ok!
I’m kinda mad that they got rid of the style thing so I can do auto velocity’s. The app is perfect and I love to use it but can you bring back style so I can do the auto velocity
I’m happy I’m not the only one cus I thought my app was glitching but it turns out you got rid of velocity. Why would you do that? Pls put it back
Style button brought the most attention to the app hopefully this isn’t permanent
I use this app for la Velocities but now it can do it! This app has trashy transitions that I can not use when making a edit!
Style option is gone it was there before and now it’s gone and I am so sad I can’t make my edit on Monday and I’m at stressing out so bad fix the app rn please
I think CapCut should add 3d text
"It was so much fun but it took all the cool effects and velocity away after update , now I strongly dislike the app and will not recommend to anyone"
If you make velocity edits on TikTok you need this app this app is so helpful.
"I log my tiktok account into the favorite sounds thingy and it says ""no favorite sounds"" this is annoying please fix it"
Ok so when I first got the app it was great and all but it doesn’t have music THAT IS GOOD
Capcut is better than kindmaster (my opinion)
I can’t install the app and I got rid of so much of my images and why did you get rid of the velocity and why did you get rid of the style option
"okay, when i try to do a ghost effect, i use ease out 1 and the video zooms out instead of zooming in. capcut pls fix this!!"
Listen man so my iPad’s at Burger King so I can’t play it
It was working fine and i really loved it! i would always use then it said i had no internet🤨It never worked so please fix it or else
"Capcut is a great editing app, but we need smoother slow motion please. It is so laggy!!
This would make the app so good!"
"I got more storage space on my phone &, it stated my storage is Insufficient, how??? Fix it. And, up top of that I got the new 13 pro I’m having problems with your app…"
CapCut is very good in my opinion but I keeps muting my audios when I try to make a video so please fix that
Amazing just amazing in every aspect.
The app is good for beginners just needs graphs
yea not bad but the transitions are a bit choppy (but what am i really expecting from a preset transition honestly) and people easily using this while others have to go through hardships to make their edits is a bit yk.
"I use this all the time and it’s one of the only editing apps without a watermark, TYSM TO THE CREATOR FOR THAT ILYYYY"
I love this app it’s so good I love making edits on it it’s so simple
"i like this app but if only you could bring back the ""hit"" effect it was my favorite effect i would always edit with it and make videos but now that it's gone i cant please bring it back"
Every time I made a long video it would say “not enough storage”but when I deleted all of my storage it said the same thing!!!!!!!
It’s app help me with editing Roblox I LOVE the fancy filters
So many effects and transitions it’s so easy to make an edit!
I like it for that
OK I deleted all my pictures because your pets I only have three because it keeps saying my storage is too full and it’s annoying!
"I don’t like cap cut because it always says I have full storage
T"
Idk what happened with the latest update. But the app literally doesn’t let you save the video to your phone anymore.
The application is very nice but please support the arabic text🤝
Sometimes u have to delete everything and u still can’t use it
Ok i really like capcut its a good edit app but hear me straight I deleted 57 photos and it said i still have to many photos and i only took 5 photos to make an edit🙄
Don’t get me wrong I love Calcutta but I only use it for gacha
This app is so amazing! It has cool effects and features!....but everytime I try to export something it keeps kicking me out and it’s a problem...
This is the worst app ever you can’t even add the audio from your camera roll because it never shows!
Yesss
"i like this app i really do, it’s simple to use for the most part. the only thing i have to complain abt is the amount of lag it has. it could just be my phone, but the lag and glitches are really annoying."
It make. Me have lot of likes
This app is good for beginners or even bros or good it’s sooooo good really recommend it
this app is good overall but i gave it a 3 star because it keeps saying no internet connection when trying to add animations to my video but i am connected to the internet. in uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it didnt work.
"get rid of the new update oh my gosh. I’m a fanpage and I loved this app and I used for my coloring and it was really nice but the update ruined it. Get rid of the update no one likes it, sorry not sorry. 💀"
Good app but I just can’t get the update
The style along with other icons keeps vanishing...disappointed.
Won’t let me add more screenshots :C
Better Than KineMaster tbh
"i love this app! but could it be used offline? if im in the car, i could edit and get stuff done, but i cand because i dont have wifi."
This is the best app I love even better than KineMaster no afence but it’s true get now 💞💞❤️💖💕🥳🥳🤩🤩😂😂😂😇😇😇😍😍😘😘😋
I’m trying to download the app agin and I can’t idk why tell me why I can’t download it back if it’s a bug tell me what I should do to get it back
Love this app until it erased my data…
good app! but i suggest you should make it so you can split the video while it’s playing so it’s easier to split on the beats if someones making an edit.
"Why people don’t like this 
( ˘ ³˘)♥︎"
I love it so much it helped me edit and post on tiktok
Amazing app ! Mad effects
I LIKE THIS APP ITS NICE AND SIMPLE BUT IT WOULD BE BETTER IF WE GOT GRAPHS. And smoother transitions…. I dont wanna be taking up my phone space cause i have to be saving multiple videos to edit. Thank you
"this is one of the best editing apps on here, plus it’s free. the only thing that is missing are graphs to help control the speed of the transitions. with this, capcut will become godly"
the fkin CapCut text has the feature captions but it doesn’t fkin work at all
Me and my sister use it for animations and intros so ye pretty good app!
it’s great i use it to edit all my videos but i have a problem . i can’t do the audio it says no internet connection. my internet connection was fine
I absolutely recommend for beginner editors to use
I love this app and it’s really fun and I really like doing edits so yea
I use capcut a lot for my fanpage and I use this app Phonto so I click overlay but the picture won’t come through and it’s a PNG. can you fix it ASAP it used to work and I really need it !
This app is so great. I love it. It has a lot of features and effects.
So i just got this to make an edit and its super easy and free its just amazing im speachless
"there is so much stuff to do, i’ve been using it for like a month and im still finding new features. super easy to use"
PLEASE add graphs so we don’t have to use premade transitions. The rest of the app is very good!
Um I don’t know how to edit something
"Love this app,has cool and free effects and really helps small creators ."
I ABSOLUTELY LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVETHIS APP. I use it everyday to make edits! Because of CapCut my camera roll is FULL of edits!! I love it!! Time to dance 🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟 💃🏼 🕺💃🏼🕺💃🏼🕺  get the app you won’t regret it ;)
I've never seen an app like thisss before. Its so amazing😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
"LOVE THIS APP! honestly amazing, just amazing. but a few things. please let us import fonts and add more fonts."
"Pretty good editing app for tik toks u see on fyp, recommend"
I’m about to delete this app it keeps glitching and I had to delete a bunch of my good edits so I could continue working on one I’m literally raging right now
It won’t let me use the bling section and some different sections and it says no internet connection PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i’ve been using the app to edit and i was doing good but ever since the recent update it’s been laggy and my edits are offbeat now. then when trimming videos it very slow and lags a lot. please can u please fix this?
Hello I live in Florida and when I go into CapCut before I updated style was working now it’s not please tell my and thank you
There used to be style effect. It is no more there. I don’t know if that just me or everyone else has same problem
It needs more translation and put style button back on and velocity and flashes
"How come this app 
 Can only use in Vietnam 
But can’t use in U.S ???"
I love the video editor but there is some flaws like right now the style icon is not showing up.
This app is really good and easy to use
It’s the worst thing ever. It’s so complicated and gets me so mad this should be more easier and not have so much buttons to hit this should be banned forever
"okay, i use capcut all the time for my videos, its great! you have been coming out with new updates, but…one thing thats been here a long time. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

okay, lets say i wanna add an overlay or smth. i can, but sometimes i have to close the app and re-open it. 

“nothings here- start recording memories now!” is what it says, then i close it and the pics pop up. pls fix this, its annoying!

other than that its a great app. love it!"
this app helps me with my edits but it’s then it just makes delete all my apps photos just to play it and i need them to do something about cuz it’s getting really annoying
"I LOVE THIS APP SO MUCHHHHHHHH!!! <3 
Its free which is amazing and there is so much you can do on it!
Just get this app it's is amazing lol."
It was a nice really great app but now it costs money and stuff and it’s super mean and now I can’t edit my videos ;(
Gets great job done.
"Stop! When your done with your video don’t click that share button just yet. Here’s why…
After doing 2 test projects. And looking at the add-on effects. I have decided Three stars. 3 stars are rare for me you should feel good about this it’s not to bad . 1 star because it’s fairly decent. And another star for ease of use. Another star because the logo can be removed on your phones editing software.  I did not rate this 4 stars because it has locked out features I couldn’t test. I didn’t rate this 5 stars because it has a logo at the end of every project. Which I hate the most and would have rated it 1 star. My biggest peeves on ANY item doesn’t matter who the company is and I’m not pointing at anyone. But I hate on any product of whoever it may be at the time I hate locked out features and logos. 
Based on if I’m doing a something important to show for school or something for work the end logo could fail the project. OR locked out features could be the key of adding that special twist that I couldn’t get. So I wouldn’t rate it for schools or work. This solely based at Home Use Only. And that is where this product really shines the most in my book. What I’m saying is you can add videos from anywhere just don’t use for school or work. If your doing projects on major stuff the logo will be it. But this is removable IF you use your phone to edit that out. If you do that. And only if you do that. I could see it cleared for school and work. If they remove the auto logo appearing at the end then it just might rank up on my favorites list. But all features must be unlocked with no logo to make that list. It IS on my recommendation list. So try this out. Don’t forget to cap out that logo before sharing it places."
Had it before all the til timers came now the shove the logo down your throat
Hey this is a capcut editor! I suggest having graphs it will make transition (custom) smoother :)
This is the best app I had it’s really good✌️❤️
I o Like the game a Few glitches but it’s good I really like to make my gotcha skits I recommend this game for everyone I love CapCut!!!
Why does it take so long to save the vid - jasmine my friend
The app takes too much storage it’s a good editing app tho
Very fun and I think it’s a good game or whatever to do when you are bored! 9/10
Yay
Capcut would’ve been more powerful if it had graphs tbh
"i think a lens blur like after effects would be very good to put in, a lot of others also would love if there was an effect like the bcc lens blur on ae :)"
Can u guys please add an erasing effect cause I need it
it is amazing! great for editing and making montages it’s free no water mark and high quality with many options to choose from
So I’m 11 years old it says for 12s but I’m good at editing tho😂👍
"This app is amazing, though it can use some graphs and better keyframes, maybe better velocity? It can use some help.."
"so i’ve been using this app for a while, no problem until now. the problem is that when you export the video it comes out off timing. all the transitions come off beat to the sound being used."
It is good but where is style!!! I don’t have it no more 😡
I gave it an 1 star it keeps telling me to delete all of my stuff it really annoying and I delete my apps and still can’t get into it
Its literlly telling me to delete stuff i deleted over 10 photos and I recommend vita you don’t need less storage for it and works better then this
☆
Amazing app but i hope add and support language Arabic
We need the style option back NOW
Best editing app rn
Tho is great but I need style
"Why are there so many bugs, none of them have been patched yet :/"
It’s fun and easy to use
Where is auto velocity? I’m about to delete the app.
Very good I love that they have no ads
This isn’t good app I rather use the vita app. Takes forever to load and then says error. Please fix that
"I try to download, it shows a screen where I have to put my password in, and then it tells me to do it AGAIN."
"The short cut says could load try again.
Its really annoying and hard to use."
So personally this app is really amazing!! once you know how to edit its so easy.
0 ads and easy to use
The arabic language is reversed and doesn’t make any sense
The graphs aren’t really working.
This does not work the first time I used it it worked fine but the second time it just kept resetting
i like this editing app but kinda mad that I don’t have the template options.
This app is great! I just wish there were mor songs
"It’s a really great app, I totally recommend."
Hi I was able to make one video edit but my storage was full with no photos
I seen this app everywhere and wanted it
Well I love it is just that how can I get templates 😂
it’s great for editing my projects and works really well. i haven’t had any issues or anything and it’s definitely a great app for beginner editors.
Did the privacy say track me😀👉🚪
Thank you guys 🙏
I was gonna use this to edit my videos but I couldn’t even add something to the background! It would just add a scene of the thing kinemaster is better
"Huns, y’all better add like graphs bc graphs is literally what we need can y’all add graphs oml"
The best video creator/editor I’ve used 👀.
Can’t do anything with an app when it constantly says “no internet connection”. It refuses to work and I have nothing to fix it with.
"Easy to use, good affects, transitions, and animations all for free."
Uhm it would be really nice if my progress would save
"where is the style option, it’s not there anymore and there is no updates on the app, please bring it back. overall it’s an amazing app."
I love this app it’s been what I’ve been looking for so smooth and cool!!!
It’s amazing I can’t believe that it is free
Make a Mac version of this
I don’t have the velocity
Literally after I spent an hour to make this one velocity edit it bugged out and I can’t undo it I’m not even gone try no more💀
CapCut is a great app with a lot of features but if you have any parent restrictions on your phone then you can’t download you photos and videos.
"HELPPP THE AUDIO IS DECLINING !! Can devs please fix this? I’m devastated, using all of my time doing these edits."
"idk why but for some reason whenever i go to style, it doesn’t give me the velocity feature. like it literally doesn’t even show up. so please fix it, thanks. :)"
Such a great app. Download it everyone its the best app down appstore! Now 🤪🤪
"So far so good love it 
Just waiting for the smooth slomo lol:)"
Such a pleasant surprise!! Thank you for such a great editing app🙏
"I still haven’t gotten the dynamic light wave effect. And I’ve updated the app, can you please fix it ?"
App has bugs that make it impossible to use. Better to just find another app
Ok so i this take my storage to but I do lovvevveveve this app
"Hi, I downloaded this app to edit my photos with 3Dzoom style, but there is no style tool for iPhone users!!!!
Whyyyy?!!!!"
So um i give it nothing bc it doesn’t appear the plus :( I’m sorry capcut but only 2 stars :(
I cant figure it out and it makes me vary mad sometimes
It keeps saying no internet for the tiktok sounds!
Plz remove this when we have to much storage we cannot edit plz remove it
“Add beats” aren’t working.
I love capcut i use it a lot
Don’t download when you try to get a template it takes 5 milllion years to freaking load I’m done with this stupid app
i rate this a 1 because for some weird reason it said insufficent storage. so i deleted maybe like 122 photos and it still said insufficent storage😔. so i deleted more and it still said that! i deleted 10 apps but it still said that. i deleted more photos and i only had 20 photos but it still says that!
Love it so much! So useful for animations and etc! <3
This app is AMAZING I’m totally in love with it and there’s is nothing that is bad about this app it’s PERFECT
PLEASE add graphs and real effects so that people who really want to edit can and not just use presets
The app just needs too much storage
This is trash why I did this and one day it changed now it access photos there creepy and crazy someone is taking over cap cut pls help the creator someone made is wired
i worked so hard making all my gacha videos and all of them got randomly deleted. all my hard works is gone. forever. thanks CapCut.
Yes! It’s a good app but NOTHING CAN BE SAVED!!! I am currently have if a mental breakdown cause Months and Months of work is gone. I would stay up till four a.m. working but now it’s GONE!!
it won’t let me update my video even though i have 50% of my storage left:( the app is an amazing editing app but it won’t let me upload my videos from the app😭
Cool app but if you knew how to use then that would be great but you don’t know how to use it then it creates trouble 😫😭
This app is so good it should be five stars! Like I love it!
The auto caption feature on the recent update doesn’t work.
Omg I love it my firs time it did take time but I really love this!!
It says to clear up some storage I cleared about 600 photos and 45 videos and it still didn’t work
"I’m a Ipad user, and it’s hard to use because it’s small on my screen."
It’s great keep up the good work
It’s like saying I have to do like CapCut requirements fix this.
"so i love using capcut, and i am an editor. but... i dont really using keyframes because they dont have motion blur / mirrors. i would love if you guys added mirrors! if that was added then it would help! tyy"
Very nice
Update please
I love this app. It helps me with editing I am so thankful. 🥰
to the key frames option please add a custom graph and premade graphs for that
The update is glitching. It doesn’t show which sound I added.
"It’s amazing, great video editor, love it so much."
I like the features of this app but it keeps crashing every minute😑🙄
It would be great
They lost 3d zoom it’s not on the app anymore :(
Where did the style edit feature go???
My app won’t work and it keeps on saying connection error or something along the lines of that.
goofy ahh productions I’m gonna take a pic with cardi b inside my cardigan
"Amazing app, only wish there was an Mac OS version"
Cap cut is good but I don’t have the newest effect the automatic velocity
It’s Super good when I’m trying to do intros and gaming videos
It’s pretty good
CAPCUT IS AMAZING only if it did a smooth slow mo but still really good
It’s really good but…If I do style it says u can’t just adjust this clip. there’s a problem.
I shouldn’t have to delete the app every time and lose previous videos just to use music
uhh never mind my last review it was a mistake I love you capcut
This app helps me post TikTok videos
So I’m a roblox YouTuber and this REALY HELPED I also make edits to share and also THIS IS THE BEST APP FOR IT get this app!!!!!!!😩😩😩👌👌👌
I LOVE THIS APP SO MUCH IT HELPS SO MUCH AND ITS AMAZING! I would love if there was even more effects and animations but otherwise AMAZING!!!
so im a 10 year old and i love using this its so helpful and easy to use once u get used to it. i really have nothing else to say so yea
Good editing app but sometimes it gets very CO placated but besides the point it is great for beginners.
I’m fifi I love it fifi is hungry fifi is a bunny when fifi the bunny is bored fifi the bunny makes snap chats withcapcut
Hey umm so it won’t let me do anymore vids it tells me to able album but idk how to so please help me!😬😭
capcut literally saved my life. i got over 200k likes on a video because of this app. you guys have to try it out.
"This is a great app but the problem is that u can’t pick the songs or type of edit u want.

1. Can’t pick the song

2. Can’t pick the edit

After all this is a really good app."
I love this app I have made so much with this app I love it and it is so fun
I use this all the times for edits and TikToks and I just love it it’s so amazing
"Hello, I’m a roblox editor. I’ve made 30+ edits on CapCut, and today it crashed due to a video I uploaded being too fancy. I’m VERY mad. Every single edit I made is GONE. very upset, used to be my fav app. I’m deleting now. FIX YOUR APP."
Takes up to much space sorry.
i’m trying to do an edit but its all laggy and it keeps freezing up but when i save the video the speed of the video is normal.. but it’s hard to edit on the app bc it keeps freezing. pls fix i don’t wanna use inshot 😒😒😒
I love it but there is no graph for Instagram or TikTok editing and no motion blur and it’s very I don’t know
Can you add it pls?
"this app wont let me download it, I hate this app but I love how it doesn’t have a watermark yk"
Lol
SOOOOOOOOOOO when I use CapCut I have no storage . BUT I delete a lot of my photos but I still have “no storage” I think we should fix that
"Very nice app , why not including Arabic language !!!!! Would you please add Arabic language to this beautiful app cap cut . Thanks"
"How do you all get that 2K/4K quality, I updated it and have nothing there still 1080 :("
"It was running very smoothly, now it's very laggy and not smooth when running the app now."
"I rated this a 4 because
1 it needs more like clips 
2 it’s to glitchy 
3 the clips take forever to load 
4 it needs more better quality 
But yeah if you can pls do it"
Every time I try to make a edit it always shows only one and this gets me bad plz fix it
"Awesome, But won’t work to install."
I was using this app only for velocity edits but then they removed it i want them to put the auto velocity feature back :)
this app was amazing i made so many edits but the new update messed a lot of stuff up and i can’t make a water mark anymore or use the style button. please make it how it was before. thanks.
so i found out capcut deleted velocity! and i rly need them for edits. i dont understand why they deleted but i’m a little mad.
Video and song/sound always out of sync when exporting. Makes app unusable
Ok ty bye have a nice day
This app is not that helpful and I also take my time to get videos that I recorded on the app
Okay so I Delete 300 Screenshots and I can’t even SEE A VIDEO
You should fix it because when I edit it does edit but not how I want it to be so please fix that
"I made an edit and none of it saved, im so mad. Why did this happen? Huh capcut? why?"
Don’t use this  app it toon away my TikTok acc over and my Snapchat acc I hate that
"capcut is amazing. it might seem like the edits are bad, but it’s actually really good if you use it correctly. it’s so simple and easy. but maybe add more transitions?"
They took of the velocity and I had it now I don’t so pls put it back in it to editttttt
You need to add like more songs like the top 100 hits or something like that not just tik tok songs
OK first your app is amazing second it won’t let me import videos at the first try of getting the app please fix this I can’t even do any anything! PLEASE FIX -guud buy
CapCut is great. I’ve been using it for the past 3 months. But CapCut needs to add cc smear and cube tower please.
Ye
it’s cool but every time i want to edit it say storage is full but i have one video
Ok it says my storage is full it makes you delete have of ur photos and it glitch and delete all my edits WORK ON IT PLEASE
This app is really good to do edits and it just perfect
I really like this app! Me and friends love this app 😍😍
Your Game is not working very well it’s keeps sending this cloud thing and it won’t let me download it what happened
But give us a larger overlay limit please I’m trying to tween 💀
Just add it back :(
"When I was trying to make a video is said I had to much storage, so I decided that I was going to delete some. TURNS OUT I HAD TO DELETE TIL I ONLY HAD TWO PHOTOS AND FIVE VIDEOS AND IT STILL WON’T LET ME EDIT MY VIDEO!!"
Cap cut is AMAZING but the one thing I struggle with is storage but besides that is amazing!!
"this use to be my favorite app to edit with and i deleted it a while back cause i haven’t edited in a while then downloaded it again and now it’s acting up, the sound glitches in videos and if i extract the audio it will keep glitching and my videos come out delayed and glitchy when i finish them"
I would NOT recommend for Gacha editing if you tween! The back ground is always messy for me tweeting messes up TONS!!!though if if you only do Gacha for screen shots that’s ok but DO NOT recommend doing Gacha tweeting or animation
It was good at first but now all i get is can’t Load try again later terrible
I’m using capcut and whenever I use jumpcut sometimes it works but sometimes it goes super fast and the video is super slow capcut is getting me so mad what the heck
Not working properly even though connection is proper
I love you so much honestly😔🥴
I will say this is better then kinemaster
I love this app but recently with the new update the app keeps kicking me out and getting rid of all my progress
I overall love this app! I just wish the shake motion in affects was better! It would be really nice to have some affects like after affects in here! But overall the app is amazing for my edits! 👁👄👁💅🏾
So good
The app great but lags way too much for me😃🔫
Love this app it's got amazing transitions and fonts styles and very easy to use :)
The app is amazing dont get me wrong but I cant even go through 4 photos with transitions without it glitching like what?.
The app is good but i keep getting frustrated because it will not stop lagging.
"I love it! It’s awesome, except it lags, which makes it really difficult to use,,, 👁💧👄💧👁"
I have this issue where if I put to much photos or not that much it’ll start freezing up and not letting me finish:/
It won’t load my camera roll or any of my photos every time I open the app.
CapCut is really good use it idk cus larry got that …. ANYWays bye if your a YouTuber reading this ily
"It’s not working it always crashes and the effects are not loading. Please fix, thanks."
Me
Ever since the app got updated Capcut keeps on lagging a lot and it’s starting to get annoying
I’m disappointed because you removed style.
Bring back style I can’t make velocity anymore. Just bring it back and I will continue editing.
Hey besty u can rlly do better on the smooth slow but stealer u tried ur best! Love ya capateecut<3333:!!!!!!
"Previously, there used to be a “style” feature on CapCut but I can’t find it, and now I can’t add velocity to my videos."
Please do something in the next update that supports Persian fonts!
The sound isn’t working and sometimes the app just deletes my progress in something
"It’s very good to edit, on CapCut and stuff like everything on there is what I need. I just find some tiktok trends and I just edit. It’s really simple I love CapCut and can’t live with out 

ITTTTT
T
T
T
T
T

TT"
Ok so I type in my text and hit text to speech well guess what it dosent work ofc it says connect to the internet annoying never get the app
I need graphs and better effects like alight motion but free bc you’re cool
I got this app to help make tik toks but it never lets me upload an audio. Says I have no internet connection when I do
CapCut is really good for simple edits but it downgrades the quality of some imported videos and the slomo is really choppy. But overall it’s ok.
"Please solve this problem 

I have fast internet, but animations can’t download or load!"
this is a very easy editing app so that is the reason why i feel like it needs more flowy kinda animations as well
I LOVE THIS APP if you watch  tik tok  things then you’ll know a lot more
I accidentally deleted it and now I have to PAY to get it back it wasn’t even that good and you’re making me PAY??
"The app is truly great, but it would be nice if you guys could add a velocity effect."
Its a wonderful app but there is a problem with the Arabic font
The Overlay of it can it extend it a little more please if it prefer (It’s just 1)
"There isn’t really a lot of things to add, so I’d say it’s good for beginners."
I can’t update the app🧑‍🦯
Honestly fix your app cap cut all of my work is getting destroyed because for some reasons my texts are disappearing and now I can’t post it
"Bruhh its not working
Every time it says that I don’t have a good internet but i do have a internet connection but it dont seems to work at all"
Please support font writing Arabic 🙏
Bought extra storage because the app kept saying “insufficient storage” and it still wont work
Background remove option not show😡
"the app is good - great actually, but please add something similar to rsmb i’m begging 🧎🏽‍♀️"
Best video editing app ever 🥰
I need to pay
ok i love this app but i’m very mad bc it keeps making me delete a lot of photos to do one and all i want is to make a tiktok with cap cut but it won’t let  me make one so now i’m very mad and want to delete this app
i was trying to make a velocity edit and there is no style velocity button anymore
It’s nice but I just got more storage to work on my progect on it and it still says I need more I got the good amount I have so much and the app says I have none it’s 100 percent trashy
I love his app 100% recommend
My Biggest Flex Is Having CapCut Since 2.5k Downloads <3
It's my favorite editing app
Okay so I don’t like it because it says that I don’t have enough storage and I deleted like all of my pictures then I came back AND IT SAID THE SAME?!?
Hi I give 5 star I love this app so much
Everything is free it’s perfect. As a beginner editor it’s amazing
Please notice me here! I can’t find the templates it wont show. I install and uninstalled it million times now but nothing is happening. Please fix this. Notice me here.
"I can express how much I love this editor,I was expected some big catch but NO,ITS AMAZING. DOWNLOAD IT YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED"
Where did Style go? I loved using auto velocity.
Hey so capcut for the new update released auto velocity and one is gone now I don’t know where it is now what happened?!
Nice app I love it I just ate burger with eat but yUM is red so bread weed watermelon ewwww hahaha your orange juice yummy lol haha flee the rats
Why did you guys get rid of auto velocity? I got this app for that reason
The updates are good! CapCut please keep it up!!
my auto velocity gets so glitchy and laggy and ruins my video it worked perfectly fine the first time but i don’t know why it started doing that
Magic from heaven
It keeps says no internet connection
Would not let me do anything it said it could and kept restarting
Great app! It would be awesome to add Chinese auto cap generation in CapCut.
Literally let me here the sound when I’m screen recording on discord you emos
"I can’t find style, i see many video and many users have issue like me! Style icon in photo editing doesn’t exist 😒"
It’s awsome but it makes my iCloud very full
Good just needs to have more bitrate
the app would be a 5/5 if yall added that
"I can do everything BUT add graphs for better transitions, how smooth it is, but like any other editing app, they have graphs >:(. You can add anything else BUT graphs huh, this app is good but not as good without it."
make this app type farsi
I love the app but  it deleted by itself so now I been trying to download it for like week and it still loading
"When I click on effects it says no Internet connection, and Internet is connected with good mbps"
This is a really amazing good editing app and plus it’s free! :D
"Don’t get me wrong I love the app,I just need a smooth slo mo,that’s all I need.💀"
"The app is awesome but take to much storage
10 GB!? That’s to much
My iPad can’t take that much and now I can’t post😩
Pls fix pls pls"
It won’t let me update my cap cut for new effects
Can’t find the style button Anywhere to do the 3D filter
I would give it a good review but it always freezes or crashes.
Get your stuff together why isn’t letting me update it .??? So I can edit my pictures with 3D zoom
"i really like this app. no watermark, very simple to use, and i love using it for my edits. but sometimes i run out of transitions and animations and i don’t want my edits to all look the same so please please add more animations"
It’s a good editing app but it always says I need storage but I have no pictures and I have barley any apps that makes me mad.
"This app is frustrating to me and it deleted my work 4 times, the creators should make this easier."
i love this app for editing and all that but today i was editing a tommy and tubbo edit and it happen to make the buttons so i can’t click them?
i like it but when u put the speed on 0.1 or 0.2 it looks like it’s lagging so i would want that to be made more smoother...
I don’t know how to get premium on iPhone
So I was editing something for tiktok and then my cameras wasn’t working for face time tiktok etc I think I might of been bc of this app
"Every time I send my video to someone, they receive it pixely."
I made a fighting action movie on yt and this helped alott
U can do free green screen!
It keeps loading it been 2 weeks and it’s still loading.
"My capcut got stuck or I don't know what's wrong, it won't let me put text or effects, etc."
None of my buttons work! I’m trying to use overlay but it won’t work! And when I’m trying to add text it won’t work either
I’m just here from Madi :)
It’s all for free! No watermark either!!!
"So I literally dont have a lot of apps and I have NO PHOTOS OUR VIDEOS and it’s telling me that there’s not enough room on it, like UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"
I love  CapCut so much i make rly good edits me and my bffs love it soooo much!!!
i used this app a lot when i first started editing. very beginner friendly and no in-app purchases
"hello capcut i am a really good editor but i feel like my edits would be way better if i had motion blur like video star, and i don’t want to pay. so can u pls give me motion blur, it would help a lot"
"please put the velocity edit maker back i beg you i loved that it was super great now that it’s gone it’s rlly sad, so please js pls put it back if you may.?! :("
It super delayed plz fix I use this everyday on my tablet
"Love it but it won’t let my tiktok sounds go to the app 
It just says no internet 

I have internet"
i made a few edits being able to get my sounds from my saved tiktok list but no it keeps saying i have no internet? it’s been doing this for days now…so why isn’t it letting me choose a sound saying i have no internet connection 🤨 fix this please its pretty annoying.
"I like this app,a lot actually but the quality is really sucky :(("
bc what happened to the text?? Please help me
Capcut made a child but MADE me TAKE CARE OF IT but i named it shrek
"i love how we can add new fonts, but does anyone know if we can delete imported fonts? it would really help me"
Super good and easy to learn!! I use it for Gacha And it’s good for editing photos
"I have a request to you , Please do add ‘Malayalam’ language from South India"
I have to wait like 10 mins for my video to load than I always get “error”
"Idk what to say, read above."
This app doesnt have style function on my phone!!! Why does this app had different formats for differ phone!! Such a bummer!!!
"This app was good, until it deleted all my edits😡. I’m so sad because of them were some of my best, and it all gone now."
I love this app for making edits
It took so long to download capcut
Even time I try to edit it says try again it dose not work
I love it but I hate it when I have to delete stuff so then I can make stuff in CapCut.
Very good I can make anime edits so easily and get likes on tiktok 😉
"It awesome Go  download CapCut 
🦋🦋🤍🤍"
I am in love with this app it’s free no watermark it’s amazing! Transitions and transportation are clear and amazing!
Best editing app ever that’s all
"Really appreciate to the developer and sincerely thanks for yr efforts for free 
best app ever"
I love this app its not pro its very very very perfect thank you so much for creating thus app😘❤️
"cap cut is amazing and i love it but there's one slight issue, i don't have the auto velocity yet and i've been waiting for months. other then that capcut is amazing!"
I like it but I don’t like the constant crashing/ freezing or the fact that it takes 30 minutes to reverse a 5 second video
Not updating I did not ever get update for 3D pro zoom cool app
i have updated and still nothing. It’s a good app for beginners but it seems like I never get the style updates.
"After the update it started to stutter, it’s glitchy"
it’s alright if you wanna edit clips but if you make edits like in tik tok it’s basically cheating
I don’t know? I just love it
"Like I said in title, that error always happened in my iPad , asap fix that error."
"i’m a beginner editor and i don’t edit much but when i do this is my go to app, great effects but i wish it was easier to use an overlay"
So easy to use
Hi lover the app but I can’t update it can someone help me ?
So I got audios from Tiktok and I clicked on something that oh my favorite audios from TikTok will go to CapCut and it didn’t work last time that i got in i use them
has everything you need!
It’s good but too difficult
It don’t let my in 🙄😔
👍🏽
It’s amazing but it needs to add limited overlays
The new update messed up all my fonts so now I don’t have them and that’s really annoying

Can’t do simple functions without this app crashing and force restarting my iPad garbage app
This app is great but pls I’m requesting more shakes more soft shakes instead of rough ones

"Pretty great app for beginners, terrible for advanced 8/10"
Fix it pls it’s taking all my space and it’s says I can’t install anymore app even tho I deleted it pls read this and pls fix it
It's pretty good for beginner editors or for experts and it's pretty easy to use
One of the best if not the best “Free editing app for iphone” recommen.
Bruh it’s so cool
I haven't used it yet I'm waiting 😏
It finally works!!!! >:D
Bro this app is soooo good!!!! I can’t even explain how good it is 😭
i really love this app but i hate that i have to edit the text in another app because y’all don’t have it
I can’t download the 5.4 update
I cant insert TikTok songs it says no internet when I have internet every thing else is good but I have been wanting to edit BUT I CANT PUT TIKTOK SOUNDS AAAAAAAAAA
I’m addicted to this app!!! Finally a free welcoming great app
"Okay so, it’s been downloading for like 30 minutes and won’t download. I’m on a iPad, one of the smoothest electronics. This is a stupid app! If I could rate this 0 stars, I would!"
"honestly capcut is a really good app, and yes it isnt like videostar but videostar is overpriced (idc what you say it is.) but capcut when i use alot of photos for an edit it just barley works so."
Hi I’m Lilly a roblox editor and my friend deleted CapCut on my iPad and I can reInstall it and I have 2GB left.
Never knew we have to pay for this app-
why this app I turned my screen and it didn’t work it paused and when I tried again it didnt work 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
"hi, so i was trying to edit my video.. as one does, and i was adding keyframes and they totally went weird, every time i tried turning it to a different angle it would bug and go the complete opposite way, and whenever i try and add keyframes to make my videos look better..they go crazy, please fix this. its very enraging"
I love this app it lets me edit for my social media !
"Ok, so... Capcut is amazing! So many effects. That’s all I wanted to say. Lol. 

-Carly❤️"
Just It says “ Failed”
"Fix the lag and fix the pause button, it’s really behind"
Okay his app is amazing but one problem canyou pleaseadd some more filters becuase there is not many. Btw I ge it if you are a new editor!
"Really came in clutch for my projects, I owe my soul to the CapCut Gods"
Can u guys add graphs in capcut like alight motion
It’s good but uses a lot of storage
It’s good and all but why do you need to care about storage like literally you don’t need to say that
"Don’t get me wrong there’s good features, except how they won’t let me look at the video if I have “low storage” when I don’t"
When i wanna loud it to tik tok it wont let me bc of STORG pls fix that is. ANOYING
"I promise I’m not a bot but bro this app is AMAZING! No watermark, ZERO payment, and I’m just so speechless!"
When I try to edit it brings me to filters😡every time😫
This app is so good to edit vida I love to use it
The best editing app in the world
this app is amazing i recommend it to anyone who’s looking for a good video editing app. it’s easy to use too
I love it 🥰 I don’t have to pay for it it’s free 💜💜💕💕💕
Why did you remove styles idiots…
I was on CapCut and I updated it and now I can’t find or use style and auto velocity doesn’t show up
Sometimes it works sometimes it acts slow idk if I should keep it or delete it
"it needs better quality for the vhs effects, and the one effect everyone wants is displacement map. please add the effect."
I can’t see the The electric border thing I really liked it please Bring it back it’s really good Great editing I guess
"Omg this is the best app, made my day. I  love using it for my TikTok. Tysm"
Could you maybe make capcut 9+?
I like it fun who made the game it amazing and good
"No matter how many times i update this stupid thing, it doesn't work"
It’s a good app and all but not to slow down vids
i overall like it no too much of a problem
Capcut is pretty good but it takes up lots of storage
How do you get rid of the Green Screens?
4 starts bcz I can’t use gifs!!
CapCut is an amazing app but i cant add any of my own songs!
Everytime I go to edit a video CapCut closes on me. It’s extremely irritating
I LOVE this app it made me popular
Add a zag 🥰
I’m just here for the 3D thing for my tiktok😂
Can I put my balls in yo jaws cann I can I
"Everything about the app is great, but you guys need to add graphs for smoother edits."
"All i have to say is i love this app , but.. please add motion blur💀"
it won’t download. It’s just loading and doesn’t even show on my Home Screen. I’m unable to cancel downloading it.
"I LOVE the app and it is free, gut I would like to be able to add gifs too."
"Dear capcut, I do not like the new slowmo thingy idk what happend but I need to fix it and I need help I am trying to make a edit but it doesn’t work please fix it."
Am speechless
It keeps on saying that my storage is full when its not
recently it keeps freezing and messing up everytime i cut a clip. like i’ll split the clip and it will just freeze as that image and i’ll have to reopen the app the get it to fix.
super easy to edit videos!
I went in it I deleted all my photos and videos and it still wont let me in can someone help me
The app is amazing but I HAD DELETE ALMOST 10 videos JUST TO SAVE A VIDEO THAT WONT EVEN SAVE NOW I GOTTA KEEP DELETING THE APP TO HE ABLE TO SAVE IT I HAVE nothing in my gallery some is wrong with yo app
I think this app is just premade transitions that’s not even real editing I hope it gets taken down soon
this is very good  but i just wanted to know why when i’m trying to make a main track video to an overlay it’s saying it’s not available???
this app is severely underrated. it’s so easy to use AND it’s free!
i am a 14 almost 15 year old girl quarantined and i can make elon musk and mark zuckerberg edits with ease. i’ve used it for a day and i’m already addicted 10/10 highly reccomend
Can you guys make the amount you can export unlimited😤
I love capcut
I really love the app. Just saw that the style icon is gone. Please put it  back
I love this app very much but what happened to the style button???? that really helped me with my videos and I'm highly upset.
It’s not letting me play the app and it’s really good and I use this app for editing so yea
so i have always used capcut since i was little but i’ve seen how many very werid or like babyish effects there are i think there should be more like free edits to put you vid / and or photos in.
i think that it’s good because you can edit tons of things!
How do you use this for ZEPETO?
Arabic font not write well pleaseee fix
Love
Ty cap cut for making my edits so good
I’m on full bars and full wi-fi and it keep saying connect to the internet to add sounds from TikTok?
I’m so lucky to have this 💕
Honestly it’s a pretty good editing app
I literally hate capcut I have deleted everything off my phone cut it off for like 20min and it says no storage
Bro I love this app so darn much
It always says I have storage problems if I got high storage like bro shut up and let me edit
It has a lot of side Effects you better off getting video star
"this app is good but like i have to delete many things i don’t wanna delete just to make a video bc it says storage is full and it makes me sad :( can u make it where we don’t need to take storage away, i tooken many things away and still says storage is full. please"

i like how easy it is to edit the speed but it’d be easier if the slow mo was smoother
PLEASE PUT BACK ANIMATIONS. I can’t find the right things for the edit without animations
my speed button doesn’t work so all my videos are the same speed or cut weird
It’s was all wonderful till I did not have enough space I deleted almost all of my vid and pic and it said I still have no more
"IM GOING TO PUT THIS IS ALL CAPS BECAUSE IM NOT KIDDING. SO ANYWAYS I WAS TRYING TO USE A STICKER AND THEN SOMETHING WEIRD HAPPENED, WHEN I PUT AN ANIMATION IT SHOWED A PREVIEW OF THE ANIMATION AND THEN WHEN I PRESSED THE CHECK MARK AND PLAYED THE VIDEO THE ANIMATION WOULD NOT WORK. CAPCUT IF YOU ARE READING THIS PLEASE FIX THIS ERROR! 

                                                          -CapCut customer 🙃lol"
I was trying to add photos and it kept saying “can’t complete try again”
"It’s giving me error says connect to internet  even tho it’s working fine 

Issue facing on iPhone 11 and 12"
Got the app from TikTok trying to do this 3D trend and they got rid of the style button or I just can’t find it at all.

Best editing app I ever used
Well if u want to make edits this is ur app
"I love capcut, but graphs would make it so much better!"
So when I saw all the ratings on this app I wanted to try it and it went all right then I made this short video and it said I had no more storage so I deleted 5 apps and IT STILL SAYS I NEED MIRE STORGE LIKE FIX THIS PLEASE😡
I’m on a sugar crash-
"idk what happened now it’s laggy and stuff it used to be good

and it also takes up a lot of storage too :("
capcut is a good app. but for some reason everytime when i try to review the video it lags or it glitches.
Bro the style button is GONE it was literally there and now it is gone and I cannot edit somebody help me
why did you remove auto velocity I’m literally crying😩😭
It always freezes on the photo then skips ahead and its so annoying I hate it.
I deleted half my apps and half my photos and it still says delete stuff
This app is amazing but i would love a smooth slowmo
It makes me a good editor
He need arabic language and more effects
"Please add an Arabic roll, and I will give you five stars"
Ok so I was trying to do a vid and it  freezes in a pose when I’m at a other pose
Yall need to let people make ACCOUNTS! or atleast have an warnng that says “If you delete capcat your projects will delete also” my projects are gone! good day.
When i move the object it starts moving on its own  to places that i didnt move it towards to
I cannot have Capcut access my album 😐😐😐 it does not work the least bit
This app is so good for editing for me
When I go to the app and went to video a pressed on it the screen just turned black
It didn’t even work ever time I tried to add something it would delete bad app!
So it’s so good I used it for anime gacha and more!!!
This is a great app I use it everyday!
It’s better then Funimate.
"I love this App so much, it’s Totally Free and no Watermarks!"
"the app is a very good app! but i literally had to delete more than 5 apps and 1,500+ photos just to do one simple edit on it. you also cant even review the edit by clicking on it. i cant do that since somehow deleting most of my data wasn’t good enough."
"Hello!., so capcut isn’t working for me😔 so can you try and Fix it some of the buttons dont work"
boi. put the auto velocity back or im gonna cry. i cannot do this anymore
"I loved when I used style and I blew up on tik tok but without style you can’t have the intense camera shake,please add this back CapCut"
My done
Just add motion blur and graphs and this will be one of the best editing apps lol
wow thanks for creating this app
I  JUST ACCIDENTALLY DELETED THE FIRST PART OF THE EDIT I MADE AND THAT EDIT TOOK ME HOURSS (I still love the app though I’m just really mad)
"I was searching up if CapCut was safe, and the results were unbelievable."
i loved capcut but then when i make a super fast fnf video it was slower and i was very upset this app became annoying
It’s not letting me update it but it’s ok
i love this so much i highly recommended it to anyone who likes to edit
I couldn’t edit yae miko it wont let me ✌️
"doesnt load videos which is what its supposed to do 
Bad do not use will not install again"
Fix the glitch where u can’t add the speed up to 100x I can’t even do velocity edits because of it
Hi makers of capcut I was wonder if you could add an effect called warp.
So my thing won’t let me download CapCut please help.
this app is okay but i’ve been getting bugs and it just erased every single video i made. never again.
Well it’s great and y’all but like can y’all add stuff like cool
It’s a great app but I hate how it says that I have no storage and I do sooooooo only 3⭐️
It’s pretty good for making edits
"something is wrong with the effects, but i still love this app"
I use this to make Gacha videos and it’s the best! I love it!
Ive ben using alot of editing apps and this  app is the best editing app so far best part is that its FREE
I love it but… I seen on someone else’s CapCut that there’s a 3D thing but on mine there isn’t 😐
It’s really good but kinda confusing for a beginner
I was trying too make edit and there was only 2 VIDEOS IN MY CAMERA ROLL AND IT SAID “Storage cleanup” SMH
tons of features and easy to learn!
This app was good for editing & easy to use but it took up about 80GB of storage!!! Its not worth that!
I love this app but I lost style
Pls bring back style on edit and velocity .
Too confusing make it easier
I use this for TikTok videos and this app is AMAZING 🤩
Fix the graph
This App is Awsome I appreciate that everything is free
Please we need velocity
Doesn’t really work and kinda slow
There was an update that did the edits (velocity) but my friend has it and there’s not an update for me
I love this app but its missing keyframe graphs.
CapCut is so stupid I hate it so much it’s not even downloading to my device I have used it before and I have seen it before
I went back on cap cut when I was making my video and it removed me talking . THATS WHY I GAVE IT A 3 STAR RATING. THATS WHY I DOWNLOADED AN OTHER APP. I DONT LIKE THIS APP!
I can’t update CapCut is there anything I can do
This game is horrible I am completely connected to internet but it’s telling me I’m not I can’t do nothing with it
It is the best app to ever exist. We love CapCut here. We love you
I don’t have the pro zoom update
Where’s auto velocity ??????????????????
No watermark and okay quality!!!
Good app but fix that annoying “No internet connection” problem.
this is amazing app but it can use a lot of improvement like marking the transitions more smooth i love this app so very fun though! great for beginners and children of the ages of 12-14 amazing app in conclusion but can use some work!😄
My video blacked out…. I can’t edit it either😒 I’m sooooo mad y’all don’t understand
"so i love this app, i use this for my editing. but whenever i go decide to edit, it says i have insufficient storage while i still have space. please help xoxo"
This App is perfect and it’s all free and no adds!
CapCut is a very easy and Very awesome editing app
i love capcut but i really want to download it on my icloud storage bcs i don't have memory on my iphone storage :)
I really like this app but it took forever to download video!
This app is great and is 100% free!! Lots of features
i absolutely love this app but does anyone have any suggestions on why it isn’t downloading??
👎
I love it it’s better than kinemaster
Arabic keyboard doesn't work why? This app doesn't support arabic
I hate the fact it's SO SLOW. Please fix it!!! I hate the slowness!!!!!
This app is awesome it really helped me get famous!
I liked it before they removed style
I mainly use the 3D effect in Style and you guys removed it?
Why is the style button removed? I’m not happy
What if you make Capcut Pro free
"This 
App is amazing! Period.
It’s really good for starters and it’s free,please add a few things tho. 
- hue affects
-more animations
-3D mode 
Sincerely, your biggest fan."
It a good app but 90% of the time I try to use it it says I have no internet connection when I do
I had no problems it’s GREAT!
Horrible
i don’t have the velocity option like everyone else
Not the beat one but rlly good for free
The app makes me eat Zendaya’s …
This app made me famous because of my edits and I LOVE IT
It is a amazing app I recommend it🥳
Good app! I recommend adding shakes and graphs!
I think it’s a great app
It’s a great app for me I can make great edits on this app
"It’s good but it won’t let me download

5/10 I recommend."
why when i try to get a video to do it ALWAYS SAYS RETRY i’m gonna delete the app IF THIS KEEPS HAPPENING AND NOW IMMA DOWN LOAD A BETTER APP
"It's really good, the effects are fine.. But when it says no storage? That annoys me and my friend SO much!"
This editor is just way too complicated to use.
literally my favorite editing app evrt
All of us downloading capcut to do the sugarcrash edit LOL
I love this app. But they always say I have no Wi-Fi but I have full bars. Please fix this I love this app.
"the app is pretty nice so far, but could you add the albums to photos so that we can get to them faster?"
what happened to the style option? i dont see it anymore.
This app is amazing but why cant we use the filters now? Im super confused that all. And if we cant use filters im gonna delete.
"nothing bad on this report just good things,
I love this app to use for my edits
free
no watermark 
built in stickers
and really easy to use i love this"
I really like IS so nice!!! Thank u so much!✨
"The app starts, but seems to hang after that.. Also, it does not work in landscape mode. I don’t understad these “Only Portrait” mode ipad apps... iPad are also used in LANDSCAPE"
When I use the templates it like won’t work at all only one photo will work but not any ather photo
The app is good over all but they got rid of style and I use that in all my edits.
"Hello this is good and wonderful but i need you to do something
Can you add these accents? And can you add the same types of them just not english
Korean
Japaneese
Spanish
Ruassian"
Ok cap cut bring the style back of the velocity bro
I hate CapCut new updates because now you care enough out velocity and it keeps taking me out the game .
it's great but where did the velocity go???
I love the app! I am editing for my channel RoseMary Roblox

VAPCUT IS THE BEST EDITING SOFTWARE also devs if ur reading pls add it so you can draw or paint but otherway THIS IS THE BEST GET IT NOW WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!?!
"Why did u update it I liked having the filters

Ok this is cool BUT when I press something on my screen it tells me to take away the storage
i can’t make this audio edit because capcut will not let me put the main audio in. i am giving a 2 star because it only helps with animation and text to speech. it’s very annoying.
This takes up so much of my space!!!!! I hate this app!!
Why capcut i deleted all my edits in this you said I had to clean up everything and I did pls can you make it stop pls thx😌

My own capcut is not showing some effects
Needs a bit more work but it’s O.K
This app is a great app you should get it
It’s a good app actually
"Please give the app for India.

You can edit soo much!!! On this app this is soo fun
Please add Persian language
Maybe remove the font called Autism?? Kinda weird and offensive to autistic people.
"Why no style option? :( >:(

"First you delete my work i spent my whole school day on, then you kick me out of my OWN FREAKING APP I DON’T RECOMMEND I HOPE THIS PERSON GETS TAKEN DOWN!"

"No complaints

No water mark!

I love who ever made this app"
"The best app ever
Thank you 🙏"
Glad to see I’m not the only one missing the Style category. Bring it back!!
The style isn’t there anymore what happened
My videos are so good
The best editing app ever if I hade to rate ♾/10
"the quality even on 4k is still blurry, i make good edits it’s just blurry."
My app will not connect to the internet.
i love it but it's not letting me get the sounds from tiktok pls fix that
I literally have eight photos in a while I make a video it’s good but it’s no
I was so so so much
I literally kick me out and the storage gets full really fast now I can’t make more videos
It’s worse
It’s fine I guess but I deleted it to redownload it it kept saying infinite storage I deleted half my photos ! Fix this 😡😡😡
We need arabic language
"you should add a bounce effect where the characters you make can bounce with a green screen. overall, the app is great."
It is extremely confusing to use and need a ton of work on it.
It’s rlly good but a little complicated but I rlly like it!
I have no words this is the best 👍
"Just plain out great app. No watermark, free!"
Thsi app is amazing
All I can say is it’s amazing
I’m a great editor (follow my funimate lesbian_strawbery)
"It appears that the 3D Zoom Style effect was entirely removed from the app. Shame, uninstalling."
I don’t have the templates option
I’m so mad why’d you guys get rid of velocity that’s pretty much the only reason people used the app
Why take away the style option that’s literally how I made my videos for tiktok
It's an easy app and perfect  for  new editers but they  removed  style😖😢😭
"This app is well put together, with an easy to navigate system, so many features and options, and everything available! 

1. First off I’d like to point out how excellent the system is. Every option and control is easy to use, forgoing overwhelming amount of possibilities. At first I was concerned that some of the options (e.g. speeding up or slowing down the video, adding effects and animation, adding text, cropping the video, or transitioning between clips) would be impossibly difficult to implement, however once I (quickly) learned my way around the app I found it was extremely simple! Usually these kinds of editing apps confuse me and make we want to punch a window, with all the complex options with multiple options off those options. Options on top of options!! (See! I probably made your brain hurt just thinking about it!!) Differing from these mind boggling systems, CapCut provides so many options, but arranges them in a system I find easy to learn, simple to navigate, and fun to use!

2. Second, I’d like to applaud you guys for not including a subscription, extra pay add-ons, or limited features which require an upgrade! When I first opened this app I instantly assumed I would be bombarded by “Pay for this and you’ll get that!” “Get premium and get all this!” Or “To get started, begin your subscription!” However, I was met with a pleasant surprise; no subscription ads! My brain then began to ponder what I would have to pay for. What was the catch? I cautiously began to use the app, expecting something to pop up saying “now you have to pay!” But in fact there is NO CATCH! After getting the app, I didn’t have to pay for a thing! How exciting is that? Thank you for not creating a subscription-binding app!!!

3. Finally, I’d like to thank you guys for your hard work in creating such a pristine app. The effects are smooth and clean, without the unwanted fuzziness and glitches. I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality edits I was able to implement. The amount of money people pay to get high quality editing tools is insane! Yet you guys give us  an easy to use, high quality, all out amazing editing app for nearly nothing! 

In conclusion, I’m in love with your app, and I can’t wait to use it even more! As there’s always room for improvement, I would suggest just a minor addition; the option to cut the songs down (maybe this is already possible I’m not sure) but every time I add music to my little short videos that are like 10-12 seconds long, there’s always an excess of song at the end, leaving me with a lot of blank space. Allowing users to cut down the songs would be awesome and greatly appreciated. Otherwise, this app is really cool, and I’m proud to be a user!

-Thanks!
-Darkpuppy, age 14."
I love this app it’s a really good edit app ❤️
can edit dinosaur yay love dino yay yay isnt such yay 10 out 10 best game if downlod plae
"Its ok, its just i cant import multiple of one photo, and its SUPER laggy"
So yes it’s amazing but when I was going to Finnish one of my edits IT DELETED ALL OF THEM AND THEN ITS NOW JUST TRYING TO GET ACCESS TO MY PHOTOS AFTER I DONE THAT ITS STILL NOT WORKING SO PLS FIX THAT 😡
It’s making some of my 2-3 hour edits lag badly so only
"Why won’t apps just do what they say they will! 

Will not add sounds from tiktok"
Please Add An Area to Create your own Gifs
I’ve cleared out most of my photo and video storages just so I can make this one video it’s not letting me this is terrible
It’s the best editing app in the world. Better than kinemaster no offense!
This app helps me soooo much.
A best app
“we’re making his profile picture on this video editing app.” “get out of here.”
Capcut when I go to create a green screen video the photo isn't matched with the green screen video.
Love in this app and I was really good download it
i like capcut but if it let you search animations or left you at the same animation spot when you go to a new clip it would be a lot easier
"Ok  i wish i can do 0 but it’s stupid, i can’t even do 1 edit without me delete information 29 photos."
"hey CapCut, make new transitions challenge"
"OK ITS AMAZING, but it only allows up to 15 minutes...which isn’t enough"
I don’t see the automatic velocity thingy
What happened to the velocity button i was looking for it im deleting this app!!😤
I love they staff because it is fun
Really good editing app.👍
I don’t like how it delete all my edits
it takes. way it long to make the slow motion better quality and i know it says make the video shorter but i put it as a half a second and it’s the same and a whole 1 min video
Why can’t we use templates or see the templates if we don’t really feel like making edits??
All it does is mess up your videos and I recommend using video star this app is just not good
I love the app but there’s a lot of bugs
So it said I had to delete some phone storage but when I did it it said the same thing
"Best app ever! 

Better than FilmoraGo (I had it)
Better than InShot (had it)

This is by far the best app for video editing!"
just awesome. 10/10
you guys should add graphs and warps so i can make juggs
"Easy to use and amazing!!!! No watrmark like kinemaster. I love capcut!!!,"
IM SO SAD YALL TOOK OFF  HELF OF THE SOUND EFFECTS!!!  LOVED THE WALKING SONG !! But other then that this app is easy and fun to use!! ❤️
It was amazing and I recommend it ✨
Every time I try to make a edit yall keep saying my storage is full

I see so many five star reviews and they all seem so fake so can the bots please leave
BRING BACK AUTO VELOCITY. Ill give u 5 stars when it comes back😹
I really really like it but they took my velocity away
I can get to the velocity and now I’m getting really stressed
OML THIS APP IS SO GOOD! Although it does take up a lot of storage!
Stream like ohh ahh
Ok so I had 3 edits THREE and it said it was full
i was playing editing a naruto video and it was getting laggy so i re open the app and it didnt save it and when i clicking on it it says i have no storage when i have 20 left 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
i like it because i’m a editor and i use this sometimes for my edits my tiktok is q.t.i.x
I hate this app so much I’m trying to download it and it not even working what is this.
Bad but
i lobe this app i wanted to start editing so i came across this and it’s amazing i love it
It didn’t even work do not get this this is so stupid and dumb
Why the heck did I put “but”?! ITS A PERFECT APP
"So, according to CapCut 2GB isn't enough storage on my phone to even START making an edit.."
"Its an amzing app for shaders, etc!"
"It’s cool like the filters are fun but the anime filter, and comic filters do not work on poc people. So that’s not vary cool."
When o try to use the style icon none of them can be selected.
We need to support writing the Arabic language
I love this app but I don’t use it as much :/  But it’s pretty cool anyhow!
See the app was goin nice till if u try to add a vid 3secs each it’s crashes so far my experience is a 1/10 I just don’t🤦🏾‍♀️
Ok I spent 6+ hours editing a video but capcut froze and wouldn't let me press on anything. So I had to delete the app and scratch my project. I CRIED
"some feature work well some don’t, it would be 4 but they removed their style section."
"i loved this app , but y’all changed all y’all’s adjustments and now i can do my coloring , if y’all don’t change them back i will delete the app and never use it again."
Very dissatisfied with CapCut they shouldn’t have removed the style button tbh
They removed big head and awesome animation in the edit part.
im in love with this it’s amazing but a lot of my stuff doesn’t load at says that i have no internet
Im literally begging!!! It would make the app my actual favorite
"i just updated this and i dont see the velocity, i think im just about to delete this app."
CapCut is really good I was horrible at editing but as soon as you practice on CapCut you get better!!
I HAVE A IPAD NOT A PHONE (when I run out of storage it says PHONE not IPAD)
I can do any new edut on my app it there any proplem
This is a horrible app if you don’t want to pay for something
i mean its ok for beginners. but after awhile it gets a bit repetitive and boring .
"it literally crashes every 30 seconds and never saves my progress. super laggy and i know it’s not me, because all my other apps work fine ? just not this one."
Thank you cap cut for a editing app 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I love it it is the most amazing app everrrr
Please add glowing text effect and more effects and 4k feature
"I don’t like this game because it doesn’t really 
Prince songs you wanted to choose😑😾"
There’s too many glitches that would make it bad
I love the app 😊
"First of all, this app is amazing except I love making anime edits, and now they removed the “style” button."
Best editing app on iPhone
Best app

My effects won’t work and neither will overlay how can I fix this?
Hi I am a beginner at editing and this is a good editing app BUT PLEASE FIX THE BLANK TEXT BUG IT’S ANNOYING!

"i honestly love this app so much, it doesn’t cost money at all, at tons of great transitions ! 💞"
I cannot use any filter or animation it keeps saying no internet connection
"What happened to the styles capcut, why did you remove it."
That’s it just amazing
Bring back the auto velocity pls🙏🙏🙏
Capcut deserves so much stars capcut is super underrated
This good app good for Gacha club/life video’s
I wish it not hard and not rlly good for me cuz it doesn’t have much great stuff
I got this app so I can make tiktok edits but the audios do not work and are very wonky
It’s good and all but the buying stuff will make me in debt
i love this app !!! it’s good for beginning editors :) the only bad thing is the slo mo !! it’s always glitchy
I can’t say anything more than ITS SO GOOD
Please make smooth slow mo
Thank u so much 👍
You should add velocity
Its a good app but my problem is you need 1 gbite to make a new ptodject thats ends up beong 1mbite
I had to delete all my 19 edits and it still doesn’t work
I have seen better video editing apps and this was just not the one for me
i deleted the app rn i’m trying to re-install it and it is just loading… but it’s a good editing app
It doesn’t have good effects it takes up a lot of storage! I hate so much!
The app cost a lot of gigabytes
It says it support. But it doesn’t.
Makes no sense maybe it’s a glitch but yrah it’s not working
It takes up way~ too much storage.
This app is incredibly awesome
I love the app 😍 but can you add graphs please 😊
It’s really good
It won’t let me make templates
"Just bring back styles, I’ll happily give five back"
i really do love capcut but they took away the style option and no matter what i can’t get it back. but over all it’s good.
So capCut is not working style is gone so basically everything just looks bad
"after updating it, it keeps saying no network connection and wont let me to use transitions or animations and so on this is getting annoying ive tried with more than three networks and its still the same pls do sth 😣"
I love this app it helped me sm with editing and the free velocity is 😍👌
I tried to get velocity it didn’t let me and ever time my storage not full it say it is
Pls make this app available in India.
"As a beginner, this is a Great Free app. Thank you!"
It is so fun and they added graphs omg it is so amazing
When I try to make a vid for tiktok it says I need to clean my storage and I hate tha
APP IS AMAZING but you cant change key frames
It wont let me make more than one video
"i loveeeee capcut and all but when i import videos it lags for some reason and it keeps doing it , i’m just trying to edit 😭."
why is the app telling me i have to delete some of my photos.. ive deleted over 100 but its still telling me to delete more?
"Okay I love it but literally it makes you delete every thing you love 😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬 like WAT 
Okay okay 
But please don’t do this it’s not settings okay 😌
So plz stop 

Bye 😽"
Please add Arabic language to the application ♥️
This app is good but it’s so annoying don’t worry about my storage just save the video.
??
I’m on a sugar crash
"I really like how there is no watermark 
Good transitions"
Please Support Arabic language
i cant press the other buttons lol
BETTER THEN EVERY APP but I want it easy to make transitions
capcut is ok but i can’t make a good edit no more because they remove style with velocity.
I like the app but it won’t let me make a video and it says that my Storage is full but it’s not
I have 4 bars and 5G internet and I can’t make the text a different Font
I don’t understand how to do anything it is so hard! They could’ve made it easier
It says “no internet” even tho I have 3 full bars 😡😡😡fix this now!
It’s zoom in instead
hi it wont let me download it just loads then goes back to where u can press to download
"Well, its good Ive had it. But, well, okay it’s a good app."
It won’t give me the velocity style
Hello lina
If you from tiktok wassup
This is really amazing app.
i love capcut so much but i wish it had smoother transitions and stuff. really good tho
Everybody else is so good at editing so I tried CapCut but it’s the worst thing I’ve ever tried
Best APP EVAR you should make it even betterrrrrrt
It not working
Thx
It won’t let me put photos only videos
I love this app so useful for editors
ridiculous I hate it
This app is the best it thought be good trans and ITS FREEEE AND NOOO WATER MARK!!!!! ☺️☺️☺️☺️ I give it a 5 stars!
Everytime I try to overlay never works and everytime I try to import never works
Its offbeat
So I love this app!  But it expects to much storage and gives to much storag.
So horrible will never ever use again don’t go on CapCut horrible horrible pls stay off of CapCut
this app used to be amazing but then it told me to clean up some storage space and i did and it still won’t work fix ur dumb app please bc this app is how i make my friends edits and i can’t live without it so please fix it 🙄
Pls fix then and now effect
This app is so good but y’all really need to add it on computers especially Mac
I gave it a one because it won’t let me put audios in my vid it says it can’t extract
Will not let me edit won’t even let me open the app
I love this app. It perfect for my roblox edits!
this app is so amazing to edit with everything is free and totally worth it!!
this app helps me edit videos
I can’t download it :(
i need the auto velocity feature back
Bring back style
It’s good but I can’t find volocity
style- “3D ZOOM” was an awesome feature on cape cut! Must bring back!!
Overall this app is good but PLEASE add graphs
whenever you add a graph the second keyframe moves back to how it was when first imported please fix this :(
I haven’t tried it yet so I’m going to give it a one star
I think it’s not the lagging fault it’s the loading one
I got capcut but it’s not letting me like get the app so…
"Fantastic app 
ThanQ to the developer"
"this app is really good but ngl it
would be better with keyframes and graphs"
"What- I deleted so many apps, photos, and videos bc of the storage am I doing something wrong?"
Got it to do the the new 3D trend and my head gets chopped of in every photo. I dont know but its getting me furious
Why is there only one review
Seriously This Is Amazing So Great I Love This Download Now
Is there a way to recover deleted videos
Love this apps helps me edit for tik tok btw my tik tok is 24Kcaty
Hey! This app is AWESOME!!! But it really needs graphs PLEASE ADD THESE AND DO custom graphs and built n graphs
ok ok so ngll this is so much better then any other editing app it’s so good
I would love to know where this “following” feature is to follow and see different creations and templates????
Keyframes wont be good without graphs please add graphs 😩
Ok so I do TikTok and i love using this app!!
Y’all already know what I’m about to ask. Where is style.
Best App I Ever Downloaded
The big problem on this app is a Arabic language not supported
they added graphs and they are very much pog
Oh I use CapCut for three weeks and then it never saved half my TikTok audios!
Need to fix audio for TikTok I have to keep deleting CapCut just to make an edit.
"so, i like it because the new effect they added😍 im in love
with this app! its so cool."
where do i get the premium
Can y’all pls fix the lag
Why do you need my social security number to download
I like it a lot
I cant use aura some how.
5
"Idk, just really good!"
Awesome editing app
"its good, but it wouldnt let me add images and when i tried to re-install it its just stuck loading and now i cant do anything."
Hi hi developer can u give smooth slomo
I updated my CapCut but no auto velocity please fix so I can have auto velocity
I hate this app cuz I was trying to do some new stuff and I can’t do it cuz it said I was out of town WHST how
It says I have no photos when I have 390 photos
this is amazing please use it it’s very easy even for beginners
THIS IS SO GOOD READ IT
this app is very useful
Kept glitching and wasted thirty minutes of my time.
I -
"this is a great app for beginners in editing, but adding more key frame and graphs would be great for editors to make their own custom transitions"
"i like this app,it has great features..but it would be amazing if they added a twixtor feature!"
I needed a app for transitions and this was it! Love it!
so i only have 5 apps one of the apps is capcut and it keeps telling me i dont have space i deleted all my other hard work on there so if you dont wanna end up like me dont download this app
You guys should add a follow cam
It’s pretty great it will lag sometimes but overall it’s a great app!
great app but where’s the style option 🙁
Made a corn edit
so i use cap cut for all my editing needs and now i can’t because it says no network connection every time i try to do something and now i can’t edit i need someone to help me
"Excellent, but I can’t add text in Arabic"
I’m during bc it keeps saying my storage full
it says I have it on my phone but when I try to open it I don’t have the app ???
The best app to edit
I can’t pick songs I want or search
"So I became a successful youtuber, and I have lots of edits. I opened up CapCut, BOOM MY EDITS ARE GONE. Where are they? You have some explaining to do."
I deleted like 100 pictures for literally nothing
"Cap cut is really good for roblox edits but there could be more animation. Otherwise,FANTASTIC!"
So it says acces ur photos it won’t lemme out a ascces on photos and I got so mad I broke my item and it fell on my toe 🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡
It’s really laggy!!!
Projects not working? :(
whenever i try to add a photo it turns black and i cant chose anything its good but please fix that
pls tell me im really wanting it 🥺
Boku no pico thanks
Good app but my Style isnt there..
The style mode is not appearing
Capcut! Why did you erase the style button
It’s not letting me fix it rn
cause they reason is because they removed velocity or the style and until that gets fixed it will be a one star rating
It’s good but my overlay does not work
The best app i have used
"i loved this app until there were bugs. i would add pictures and it would pause on one and not show the rest, please fix this"
This is a great app and I love that it’s free
"Honestly, if you would like a review here is one.
Worst game ever."
I put to many copies and it lags and the sound like mute and its not and it goes crazy capcut FIX IT
Can I get a kiss..and can you make it last forever I said I’m bout to go to war
Amazing app no watermarks and it’s 100% free!
I hate this app don’t use it its always crashing I got i new phone and I can’t start a new project
please don’t make us pay ever
Good but I can’t press any buttons?
Thanks developers
thats all i got to say bye
takes up to much storage on my device
This help me with my edits and I i really love this app so try it out it’s amazing😌
"It says I don’t have storage when I do and says I never have WiFi when I do 
DONT GET THIS"
It’s glitchy and my stuff got hacked. All my progress is lost
So when I got the app I was really hyped edited a video but now it is not uploading my videos anymore and SCAMMING ME it
its very good and all but the blur effects dont work when u download
It is so amazing 🤩
please add more effects like cideostar
Like I had a terrible time
I give this 2 stars because when I saved my video it had nothing on it I WORKED ON MY EDIT FOR 5 HOURS STRAIGHT. AND I GET NOTHING AND THIS TAKES ALOT OF STORAGE ON MY PHONE!
This app is great it to great like omg
Nuff said
This app is absolutely garbage and there’s nothing like the real videos that you see on TikTok
Sheeeeeeeeeeesh
bring back “Style.”
why would they remove velocity and the styles button i deleted it thinking it was a glitch but now two years gone.
This is 5 star 😀
Very easy to use and I love it loll
If u add graphs this app will be perfect. I’m begging. 😭
after a long analysis i’ve deducted that this app is for the bitchless
This is the worst app because the storage
all fonts i try to import say file not supported or i cannot import them.
Amazing I use it for tiktok it’s so cool!
"Ok seriously, capcut is like THE BEST video editor ever."
Whenever I make a good edit I spent for hours CAPCUT ALWAYS DELETES MY EDITS AND WHENEVER I HAVE NO STORAGE IT TELLS ME TO DELETE APPS SO IT CAN BE THE ONLY APP I HAVE
I love it for editing on tiktok very good app
I’ve started to use CapCut and now for NO REASON it says I don’t have storage and won’t let me edit . Please FIX IT ITS BROKEN
….
I hate it’ because that I’m getting really mad?!
Great editor 👍

I love u.this app is perfect
"I love this app, its just the chorma key layer make it easier to use please!!"
So I tried making a video but it can’t move so bad bad
i can’t use the 3d zoom anymore it played a big part in my edits🤦🏾‍♂️
This app is homophonic for not giving me the new  velocity filter thing  😔
If U Add Keyframing To This App It Would literally Make This The Best App Ever
How come everyone has the velocity effect but I don’t
YO WHAT UP CAPCUT LISTEN I LOVE YOUR APP SO MUCH BUT PLEASE ADD AN UPDATE WHICH MAKES THE SLOW MO SMOOTHER PLEASE
app doesn’t open
"I love this app, it’s super easy to use and it’s free. Definitely recommend this app."
This is a good app for all ages
I think y’all should make wayyyy more overlays 😪
glitches a lot. please fix this.
Why isn’t there no auto velocity For apple users?
🤓 other video editing software <<<< capcut😤
"i love the app, but please tell me why capcut lowers video quality and how to fix it? 🙁"
"everytime i open up the app and go on one of my projects, my screen freezes then the app closes by itself :/"
One of the fonts is called “Autism” and that’s not okay As an autistic person I am disgusted
My glass finisher loves this app😍
Capcut is great because it’s good at the TikTok
Good app I like it so much!! 🤪
"This good very app yes I very like mom say yus
:)"
Ok so I want to say ... I LOVE THE GAME ... but also ... I LOVE CHAT NOIR!
They removed all my hard work😭😑
It keeps exiting out while I’m trying to export my video.
if capcut was a person i’d marry them
This app is so ggod!
Can you add style back we all like it
Capcut styles are not showing up for me plzz fix it!!!
This app is fine
This app is trash InShot is 10x better. On here you can’t even connect your TikTok sounds is a lie
Best app for beginner
Cap cut why did u get rid of the auto velocity please bring it back 🙏
This app used 3.67 GB
Best editing app ever
It won’t save great app but that need to be fix
I accidentally deleted the app and tryed to write download and it was talking about a bill
I like the app
Why would you remove style??
capcut is a really good editing app or whateva 🤣 but it needs graphs and better slomos and then it would be the best 💯😾
the text animations on capcut are so bad but that’s the only problem though. capcut is so easy to use but if you add the drift text animation it will be good.
Plz re back the style part like old version ls
pls have my babies i love u sm for adding smooth slowmo 🥰💍
One word: amazing
:)
Cup cut it’s not working because this is a stupid game I ever see my life

This app won’t let me do anything
It's a good app but the photos I want don't load
"make templates available in USA, otherwise it’s just trash"

"hello I like cap cut but it keeps makeing me delete games 
."
works really well and it’s good for beginner editors
the app is awesome with cool editing and cool stuff but it just keep saying my storage is full it’s annoying it’s a okay app
This is a perfect
i want to make a one direction/måneskin edit 🤪💕💕🌸💅🏼🥺🥺🥺😩🥵❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I don’t not believe this is a editing app these are made presets.
"Problems I encountered:

1. A limit on animation; it would be nice if there were more options with animation, but a problem I encountered as well is that there aren't matching animations,
for example: Yoyo 1 only goes to the right direction. I feel if you're going to make an animation that goes to one direction there should be another that goes to the 
other direction as well, like Yoyo 2 should go to the left, (Including other animations as well).

2. In and Out; I also believe that combo animations aren't enough, In animations and Out animations should be able to work on the same clip together, not just one per clip.

3. Overlays; There shouldn't be a limit to how many overlays someone can put, it might be because the app starts to lag a bit, (which is fine, I’m still able to edit),
but then you should be able to fix that issue in order to allow a person to put limitless overlays.

4. Text; Whenever I animate a text, for some reason after a while of editing it stops doing the animations it's supposed to, for example: I put sunrise animation for
the intro and slide down for the outro, but it dissapears after a while, so I have to tap on the text and exit it again.

-Another issue with text (similar to the In and Out issue) the In and Out of the text should be able to function and work while I have a Loop, so, the Loop can start
after the In of the text and stop when it's Out.

5. Transitions; Mostly a specific one, and that's the Slide transitions. It covers up the beginning of the animation of a clip.

6. Less than one second; unable to put transitions on a clip if it’s less than one, I feel as if that should be doable.

Ideas:

1. Adding keyframes, this could help more with the creativity on the app.

2. More transitions, for example: splits, tiles (tile shift/tile rotate)."
No just no it’s bad it’s not even a editing app
Why is my text section in Chinese someone please help
I just wanna say TO ADD THE VELOCITY BACK BECAUSE I CANT TO EDITS WITH VELOCITY ANY MORE thank you.
Very good but limited
you deleted the styles
Trash. They removed the 3d style
It won’t let my friend save a video. Yeah so yeah
y’all’s app is too glitchy i was tryna make a skit on capcut but then it started getting glitchy out of nowhere and it’s ruining everything.
i like capcut it’s really good for a free editing app but it just needs graphs and a smoother slow motion and itll be the golden app
Doesn’t work
so true king
I hate this it’s so glitchy and it deleted my edits
capcut is saying that i have “too much storage” i deleted everything for that. why capcut.
Very very pog app ÙwÚ
Insane editing app 👍

이제 캡컷은 템플릿이 지원이 안 되나요? 템플릿 지원 되는걸 보고 깔았는데 갑자기 어느날부터 템플릿 창이 사라져서 안 쓴지 반년이 되어가고 있네요.
"Marzo 2022, siento que con las ultimas actualizaciones al exportar mis videos tienen muy poca calidad, parece que se ha afectado demasiado la calidad y pienso que la app está comprimiendo demasiado los videos, tengo un iPhone 13 pro max y grabo en 4K a 60 f"

저는 틱톡 편집기이기 때문에 저를 도울 앱을 끊임없이 찾고 있으며 지금까지 CapCut은 사용하기 가장 쉽습니다. 비록 제가 물건을 찾는 데 어려움을 겪지만 그것은 저뿐입니다. 저는 초보자이고 돈을 지불하게 하기 때문에 다른 앱을 얻을 여유가 없지만 CapCut은 무료이므로 어쨌든 새로운 슬로우 모 기능과 함께 좋습니다. 계속하세요 CapCut
Bien
No me salen los nuevo efecto :(

Muy buena app pero faltan muchos gráficos plis
"La app es muy buena en sí, tiene sus efectos y todo, pero por mi opinión como Editora: cuando hagamos slowmotion haya una opción de ""Optical Flow"" para q se vea de calidad y de altos FPS con una opción de 500/1000FPS. También estaría súper bien que añadan más tipos animación como las de ""After Effects""; por mi lado no sé usar esa aplicación, pero estaría bien chivo que pudieran poner más opciones de animaciónes para la satisfacción de uno. Una última opción es q añadan en el apartado de ""Efectos"" más efectos con temática a ""After Effects"" para una mayor experiencia profesional. ✨"
روعه جدا جميل و مميز✨💗
La mejor aplicación del mundo mundial 👌🏻
넘 좋은 앱인데 ㅠㅠ 왜 미국에서는 사용이 안되는걸까요 ㅠㅠ
لا نستطيع الكتابه باللغة العربيه، ارجوا حل المشكله
"Me encantan los efectos, adoro que se puedan hacer cosas extraordinarias en una app muy fácil de usar, pero me esta pasando un problema, tengo internet y la app no me deja escoger ni utilizar efectos diciendo que no tengo internet. Tengo internet, actualizo el teléfono, apago y prendo el teléfono, borro cosas a ver si es que tengo poco espacio y no cambia nada. Entonces el problema es la app y no mi internet ni mi teléfono. Por favor arreglen este problema, ya que no se como solucionarlo sola, y la edición es mi única entretención. Espero lo arreglen lo más pronto posible. Gracias y buen día."
ook i like it
Se me traba mucho xd
La App es muy buena para editar pero el problema que yo tengo con esta aplicación es que me pide que limpie mi teléfono pero yo ya lo tengo limpio y otro es que en varios dispositivos ya cap cut no se puede instalar ósea que te pasa cap cút se te subió la fama o que
Hi CapCut I don’t use CapCut so much because i use videostar but i love it too :)

"CapCut es el editor que siempre utilizo, pero últimamente a estado fallando demasiado, los filtros y stickers no funcionan, dice que no se puede conectar cuando mi internet está perfectamente bien y creo que es por la actualización, entiendo que una app no es fácil de hacer, pero a mucha gente también le a pasado lo mismo y en mi opinión creo que deberían arreglar eso, por otro lado, la app no es mala! Simplemente por la actualización, creo que muchos la han dejado de usar."
Me sale error de conexión pero si tengo conexión que puedo hacer ?

Over all it’s great I just wish I could listen to music cause whenever I am listening to Spotify my music turns off when I open the app. I NEED MY MUSIC
I JUST LIVE IT
THX TYSMMMMMM
I LOVE IT
Enjoyed my experience with this app so we just need it on pc or laptop.love this so easy to use I will recommend this to anyone who is in love with editing
"This is super good editing software, super Easy and I love the quality in the edits. It’s great for soccer edits for YouTube. I use it my self for soccer edits on YouTube great app overall."
This a great app also thank u for capcut because I’m making a YouTube vid with Capcut!
I had capcut before but I deleted it then I tried to get is back and now it’s saying to pay umm nope I am not paying for that they should make it free for every one they can say whatever they want but I am not ever going to get capcut or even mention it to someone .Why are they charging us for something we are going to probably delete in future I am not saying everyone is going to do that but maybe some people just us it a little then delete.so what I am saying is that if they want more and more people to download it they better make it for free.
"I go to camera to do some filters and I realized that nobody has changed it. I like the green screen but I have a few things to ask you. Is it okay if you make the video more clearer when you set the video slower? I don’t really like it when it’s not smooth and so glitchy. The other thing is can you add the waterfall filter? If you can’t, it’s fine but if you can, it would be wonderful because I seems so much fun to do. I love the time warps scan and I keep doing the angel ones. I don’t like the wind tunnel is appearance because it doesn’t work. If you could fix that, it would be great. I made so much edits with this app and helped me make more to Roblox videos and some turning red edits. I also make funny videos so I can send to my friends. But if you can add and fix the things I said, I would love it! 5-19-2022 at 6:11pm :)"
"I’ve been using this app for over a year. It’s followed me through my successful TikTok career and through my transition onto YouTube. I’ve never had a problem with it until yesterday.

 I’ve been working on a video for about a week now, then suddenly the app crashed. I tried opening it back up but as soon as I tried to open the project I was working on the app would crash again. 

I haven’t been able to access my project since. I’m super disappointed bc I needed this video to be up and now it seems I've lost everything.

 Any help to get my app to work again would be great."
I love cap cut! But it has recently been very hard to edit and nothing will move or work correctly for me.It’s has been a problem also because everything in the sound is delayed.
This is easy and fun to use I make videos for YouTube with this app and it’s amazing I recommend this app
"I used to use capcut for all my Roblox edits I posted on youtube and I used to post them on tiktok. It’s really good for beginners. Once u know how to edit, I recommend video star or after effects."
"Tiktok/ insta 
@sixela.locd

See my CapCut work ^^

Y’all are doing it right !! I don’t do reviews but I had to for THE CapCut ! So many good things about this app. All I ask is don’t change in a negative way. I’m broke don’t make me pay. Ofc the app could add little filters and etc but the work they put in already is enough for me . I can’t ask for to much,  it’s a free app !"
"So, I have had this app for a while and I just finished an edit of a YouTube video. I am working on the cover and I save it. The whole thing resets to what it was before I edited it. Like what the heck of course I am sitting there upset because I can’t post the video. I spent 2 hours on it and all the progress gone. Like I said great app but that made me a little upset."
"So my Capcut app updated recently, I’ve a professional editor with a successful YouTube channel, and now I can’t even edit properly. 
The audio decides it doesn’t want to line up. Then when I scroll back through my selected clips, and it’s glitchy. Nothing works right now and I’m very upset because I love Capcut so so much."
PLZ OMG IM DISIWKWKEBBS
"For some reason I can’t find the “style” button anymore or the new effect also I use that button so much for my YouTube so please fix this.

Other than that this app is AWESOME it’s so cool that u can add so many effects.
Also if you respond to me do t say I have to uninstall the app I have over 70 videos on there and spent hours editing them."
It might take a bit to learn how but YouTube and TikTok have plenty of tutorials on shakes velocity and coloring and honestly I am in love with this app the only thing I’m dissatisfied in is how late my CapCut takes to update sometimes.I’ll see new stuff on TikTok sometimes but I have to wait longer until I get my update for some reason
WHY DID YALL TAKE AWAY STYLE I NEED THAT IM MAD I QUIT CAPCUT I RLLY THOUGHT THAT YALL WERE A GOOD EDITING APP.bye capcut!
So I have Been having some issues on this app.Style is not showing up I was wondering if I used it to much because that was my first time using style and please just fix it CapCut .
"Hi,I have been using CapCut for a long time now.it has made great improvements and helped me when I was a beginner, And when they added the auto velocity a long with the other things in the “STYLE” category I was thrilled.But when I wanted to try out the new update…IT WAD GONE! I am very sad because it made edditing so much easier. So please capcut bring back “Styles” :(."
"This truly is an amazing app that I recommend for beginners! It’s free and easy to use. It does whatever any other editing app can do just for free. I do have a question though, what keeps happening to the “styles” button? Whenever I click on the video I need to add styles to, it’s not there! I tried updating the app, closing out of it, and deleting some things from storage. What’s going on? The styles button is really helpful to me when editing but it keeps disappearing! If you see this, please respond what I should do.(and yes I tried looking for tutorials on YouTube) Otherwise, thank you for this amazing editing app 😊"
Please add back the velocity style back pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee it was such a good help for my edit🥺😞
"so I was editing a video and I wanted go add velocity, in order to do that I had to press a button named “style” unfortunately it was not there, I thought I was doing it wrong so I looked on YouTube, still no-not there I had been using this for a major while with no problems i then checked if I needed to update it I didint. What is this problem? Idk maybe a bug but still cant find it. Overall its a really good app and I do recommend downloading it bc this bug is most likely not to come across from. Thank you for your time. Developer please respond. Ty"
"So I have a YouTube channel but it’s not very big right now and I’m trying to make more videos but I can’t because I have this installed and it takes up so much storage I was at 4.1 storage now I’m at 5.1 I am very mad but otherwise it’s a good app
😡😡😡😡"
"i have been using capcut for god knows how long, but i clicked into the app today wanting to make an edit with velocity, the style button is no longer there, ive done everything that i can to fix it and have spent hours looking on google, youtube and tiktok and i have found nothing. nothing has helped even though there’s been videos i’ve watched. they’re all the same thing. i’ve uninstalled and reinstalled the app, restarted my phone, still nothing. i miss my style button. i can no longer fast edit because of it 😊. i hope to god that it’s just a glitch and that it’s fixed soon. as much as i love the velocity it seems to add extra beats aswell."
I used capcut for a few months and it’s great everything is free but their is only 1 problem because it takes up a lot of storage and I don’t know if it will let me upload vids on YouTube because it can’t export but this app is still good
I saw some YouTube videos and they have anime filters but for some reason IPhone don’t
Jdhdhdhd
I love this editing app.it’s easy and nice to use . I also like how everything is free and works really good. I really really recommend this app for editing
I make YouTube videos and I love using this app! Keep those updates coming!
This app is the best for my YouTube channel
I love to edit poop😊
"I use this app for edits. (I used to use Kinemaster) It's a big upgrade from Cute Cut, or Kinemaster if you're looking to edit. I think this app is perfect where it is, it's completely free and there's no limitations to what you can use. The presets for animations, transitions ect. are really good. And as a beginner at editing, this app really teaches me things. There's even a speed ramp if you make edit audios! There's filters you can use on photos and videos and overall it's a great experience. No matter what skill level of editing I recommend it."
"I love this app so much it helps me with my editing for my YouTube channel! But I would it if u guys could add a galaxy background it would really help and maybe some more songs and affects, but overall it’s an amazing app I would recommend getting it!"
This app is a really good app. I have a few suggestions for you. I want to see if you can add motion blur to CapCut because every time make an edit I need motion blur to make it look better. Second is I want to see if you can add more transitions for the combo animation like AE (After Effects) if you look up AE edits you will see on YouTube. This app is really good though!
"I don’t write reviews but this app deserves it, I use it for Tiktok and YouTube shorts and it saves me so much time, I prefer using it for short type content vs using Adobe premier which makes the process a lot more time consuming. 

Love this app and it is a gem !"
I think this is a good way to start editing if ur a beginner!!!When I saw this app it was so easy to use!!And really easy to explain.Go check it out💕😁
"Capcut is great in all but I got rid of all my photos to free up space but that's not I got rid of,also I got rid of my games but it said ""influential space.please free up space for capcut to work"" like I don't have anything so what do you want me to do?So to all the people who will get capcut please be aware that when it says that just get rid of the app I'm just teling you that it might happen,hope yours work,again Its just a warning"
"I love capcut i really do. Its how i edit my youtube or TikTok videos. But one little problem, and i hope yall will fix it soon. I wanna edit my videos while listening to music. But every time i try to listen to music on the app capcut, the music stops. ( I listen to my music on the app Spotify) Please fix that soon. Thank you 👌"
when i trying to upload overlay and than click to remove background it doesn’t working. i tried download again but it still doesn’t working.pls help and fix this bug
"Yeah that’s right! My YouTube channel was doing HORRIBLE using iMovie but when I use CapCut, my subs go way up! Any2ays, this is definitely 5 stars. Nothing wrong with this app. No bugs or anything!"
"So I LOVE watching Gacha life Memes on YouTube and I wished my parents would let me start my own Channel, One meme I watched ended And said CapCut and I was like “CapCut?..” so I searched it up and got I and well… This app is the BEST! I make Gacha life videos to save to my photos and watch them at night! This app Instantly helped me become AMAZING at editing videos and photos. Thank you and I hope this was helpful Lol (Also I’m not a Robot I’m a human being)"
"I have used this for sooooooooo many tiktoks and YouTube videos( go sub to Gacha MangoCake btw) It is just amazing for anything you would like to edit. Being completely honest, I would change NOTHING about it. It is just really awesome."
"I might sound goofy but this app is so well created…. I’m horrible at editing things and like every app I tried is just poop, I saw CapCut on TikTok and decided to try it, I don’t regret a single thing, it’s so easy to find the things you need for your edit, it has everything you need. props to the creator!!!"
"Love your app! 10/10 would recommend if you are a YouTube this will help a TON! It’s amazing me and my friend love it so much! BUT TO THE CREATORS! Auto tune would totally sell it! Adding the option of auto tune to your app would be awesome! Thanks! Oh and lastly everyone that deals with this minor issue and I would love some extra storage on capcut, when I make a certain amount of videos it doesn’t even let me watch the videos if I don’t delete some....😕. But still I love CapCut!"
DONT INSTALL THIS STUPID TRASH SO BAD YOU CANT IMPORT ANYTHING THERE ARE NO EFFECTS AT ALL I HATE THIS DUM GARBAGE F U CREATOR GRRRRRRRRR
cap cut is a really fun app to edit stuff.Its a beginning for making cool new videos and more! I accidentally deleted it but then im reinstalling because i love it sooooo much!!
I LOVE CapCut but I have to go to Google to look for templates and other videos! I just want it to be on iPhone and on US Service Phones in general!!!
Best App ever I like this app helps me record my YouTube videos

So I’ve been having CapCut for awhile and I really like the app it’s great for beginners and also pros everything just got this new update it’s been a lot more smooth and better effects I really like the new update but I do have some suggestions I feel like you should add like more transitions because I would really like some new transitions because it might just make your videos look smoother also I would also like more stickers because those are kind of old just to me but other than that it’s such a great app I really recommend it it’s very easy to edit with and I can’t edit with any other app LOL so I do recommend it for any beginners and if you’re a pro or you know kind of know editing better than a beginner I think this might be the app for you but even though it’s really easy to use I think it won’t be the best for pros because I think they will find it too easy and also they might find it too boring because there aren’t that many effects or that many stuff in the you know the like catalogue really great app I’ve said this 1000 times in this review but I really recommend it for beginners and it is very easy to use and you can do as many drafts as you want it’s much easier than KineMaster I got it in me a lot because I am not that pro at editing LOL I mean so you should probably download this app if you are a beginner because it will be really easy for you and you can also upload them to YouTube and TikTok I think other platforms do that but I just think it’s an easier way other than copying pasting yeah and that’s it for my review it’s pretty long but I think you should really download this app it is such a great app trust me😊
Even tho I don’t do YouTube or tt I love this it’s the 1# editing app for me!
This helped a lot people say it’s hard but it’s easy but some problems when ever I have no internet and I go to favorites it said I have no favorites but I do.this is a good app
IT STILL HAS THE STUPID BUG WHERE IT SAYS NO SIGNAL EVEN IF I HAVE SINGALONG IVE DELETED AND REINSTALLED IT UPDATED IT I EVEN WATCHED A YOUTUBE VIDEO LIKE THATS A NEW TYPE IF LOW anyways please fix it i bet it’s a great app IT JUST WONT WORK FOR ME
"Like I said, love it. The only issue is, I normally listen to music when I’m editing, but this app won’t allow any background noise, whether it’s spotify, youtube etc. You have to edit in silence. Please fix this issue :("
"Capcut has been very useful to me! I came across capcut on YouTube and decided to download it! So,I got it, and what I learned was it is superrrrr helpful to beginners! It’s easy to learn and you could delete the watermark for free! But there is something that I would like to address. The “no storage” feature. I wouldn’t really call it a “feature” but it is a feature in the app so I will call it that, anyways back to what I was saying it is super annoying especially when I press the plus button to import the pictures for a video it says “no storage” or when I record music for a video and press the plus button it says “no storage” it is very annoying because I keep deleting so much of my apps and data. I almost have no more apps anymore! I only have 3 actual apps and those are for animating, editing, and drawing. Please I’m begging make it not need so much storage if that’s even possible! But another problem that I have is the slow-motion quality. It is definitely not the best but it’s not worse then some I’ve seen. Even when I put “smoother quality” it doesn’t really look like it. I use a different app for slow-motion because of this problem. I’m not saying it’s a major problem and I might be the only person complaining about it even with the new update, but it’s just my opinion and you can always get it if you want! There is one last thing I would like to address. The chroma key. It is not the best at making things transparent… for example there where two totally different colors I used for text and a background to import in one of my edits and while I used chroma key the white disappeared with the green? I don’t know if that was a glitch or I’m color blind, because those are two totally different colors. I have no idea why it did that but I had to just go with a different color! Please fix that, it was annoying because I spent time on the text and it just erased and went transparent and blank in the end. By all the things I said so far where just tiny complaints that I have. So, I’m not here to tell people what to complain for! You should definitely install this app if your a beginner. Like I said in the start very simple and easy to learn from! But you don’t need to if you wouldn’t like to! That will rap it up for my review! I hope anyone who read this far has a good morning/evening/night!!"
"I love this app extremely because of the no ads, no watermark, and no memberships! I found this app surprising to me, and I have been looking for a app like this for a year! I have some questions about this, When will new transitions come out? But, I am so happy about the great features! I have a YouTube channel, And I have subscribers because of this! I amThanking CapCut for this amazing editing app! Suggestion: Mirror sway. edit: i made this one year ago and now i use videostar om 💀💀💀"
"I’ve been used CapCut for about 2 and a half years, I edit my videos with CapCut for my YouTube channel. I’m very happy that I found CapCut also it’s very easy to use it’s not to complicated like other editing apps!"
So first thing you should probably ad is searching for the type of sounds you want to ad to your video or photo.Witch would make it a lot Easier to find instead of scrolling and scrolling. And that’s all that’s it.Lol
"Hi! I have been looking for editing apps all the time and realized that a lot of people have used CapCut. So I downloaded and it was perfect! I would have rated it a five star, but the review only made it to a four star review because a few weeks later I decided to make another video on CapCut and I tried the animations of in a out and it wouldn’t load no matter how long I wait. One time I waiting for at least fifteen minutes and still didn’t load. The fonts didn’t show either, and all that other stuff. I was stressed out, so I checked my internet to see if I was connected. I was. In facts, my internet was really good and had all those three rows and stuff, I don’t know if you understand. But anyways, my internet was fine, and I updated the app too. I went back in the app after the update and yet still it would do the same thing. I even shut down my phone and went back in, watched YouTube and see if anyone could help, and even tried going to settings and try stuff out. None of this worked, and I gave up. I’m not sure if this happens to anyone but for me it’s really difficult to handle.

But overall, this app is a really good app for editing and making videos, and I made awesome edits with this app. The options for editing are endless and fun, and CapCut isn’t that complicated as the others."
"I love this app so much! It has so much different things you can put in it. Different stickers, or animations, etc. But there is a few things I can say. The effects can get a bit crazy at times. And sometimes this app lags for me, which makes my edits glitchy.
Even now my edits are a bit blurry and glitchy. But one thing I love this all the new effects they are adding! I just love how they are taking the time and making new effects. I know on YouTube, everyone loves it and is using  them for their edits! Capcut has become so much more popular. I use capcut and video star, and capcut is so much less complicated. So basically I would just work on the glitches and lags that happen in your edits or videos you do! And a tip for the people who are new, try not to use so many effects at once, as it will look crazy. Otherwise, this app is great and great for people who are starting editing!"
"This is the best app ever! I’m on it all the time and you can use it for things like, memes, gifs, funny videos, normal videos, YouTube videos, and of course ROBLOX EDITS! CapCut is sooo easy to use yet it makes every video perfect! You can use audio it provides or you can chose your own music by eaxtracting it from a video you have saved! This app is so fun and you can name your videos, duplicate, and if you want, delete! CapCut improves all the time as they add new features! If you open the app and click on “camera” it takes you to where you can record or take a pic and it has fun filters and effects you can use WHILE recording in it! It’s got like Snapchat but you can’t socialize or anything! It’s only filters! This app is appropriate 110%! I would say 7+ is best! I do have a few ideas that would mean so much for you to add! 1. Better watermarks 2. New effects, the ones we have are getting old 3. My videos glitch when I am watching them in the app so please fix that, when I send the videos to other and watch it through our messages, it’s not glitchy, it only happens in the app. THANKS SOOOO MUCH FOR READING! BYEEEE! (RECOMMEND THIS APP)"
"So I've been using CapCut for a year and now it's really pissing me off. I'm trying to use chroma key, but the eyedrop thing or whatever it is won't move. It also won't let me select my clip. I've retried and reloaded the app many times now to the point where I'm really feeling I need a new editing software. Capcut is very laggy and you have to exit it and enter it back to get an iPad screen. (Or any other non-phone devices). Overall, CapCut is NOT the best editing app and if you were looking for a experienced editing app, I'd definetly NOT reccomend. Thanks, bye."
"This is literally pissing me off. I loved CapCut until now. No matter where it is I go, it won’t work. It says I have no internet connection when I literally do. All I want to do is add a slide down animation and then I’m done with my project but it says I have no internet connection. I’ve tried checking my connection, re starting my device, updating the app, delete the app and re installing and even looking up YouTube videos. But nothing works. Please fix. ASAP."
"Ok. First off, I'm not putting ANY hate on CapCut because it rocks and I definitely reccomend it for new YouTubers. But if you want a song like ""We Don't Talk About Bruno"" then you have to go through the whole process of extracting the sound, despite the fact that all of the other music is from Tiktok. And you can't upload directly to YouTube. You have to put it in your camera reel and then upload it from photos. Otherwise, this app is perfect. Developers, if you're reading this, please jump at the opportunity to fix these issues. But otherwise do not touch a thing. CapCut is close to perfection. If it weren't for these issues, my rating would be five stars. DOWNLOAD THIS APP IT'S THE BEST.

"CapCut is the Best editing app that I’ve ever used ,but it can use some improvements. This happened to me three times ,so I was just about to make an edit on CapCut when a button popped on my on my screen ,and said except ,so I pressed it, but it deleted all of my edits ,and at that time at I had nine edits ,so I immediately raged and deleted CapCut , and waited till I was done with school.Then I came home and I got CapCut again ,and it worked.So,the second time it happened ,and this time it didn’t just take after school ,it took ,like a week ,so I got so mad until I finally decided to use it. This third time happened to me a few days ago ,so I was making an edit and now I’m a pro at CapCut ,and I had 31 edits when I came in the car to make a edit ,guess what it said except ,and I tried to look if there was an cancel button, because I knew that button was evil ,it was up to something ,so I press the button and guess what, all my edits were gone. But, luckily I got them back so,CapCut please do something."
I say this a good app because they are good to edit skits video music videos vlog videos for my YouTube channel and yea
So I just made my first project and it was so good but I didn’t see YouTube but I still love the app bye!
"I love CapCut, it’s a good editing app but there isn’t enough music. You can connect your TikTok account to the app and it’s cool but just not really that good. I don’t know if there’s a reason why you wouldn’t be able to but I was thinking like what if we could connect our Spotify account, search, pick what song we want, and cut out the part that we want up to maybe 3:00 minutes. It would let us pick any song that we want and still let us edit the song as usual."
In just a few minutes of having the app and reading some of the reviews this app was amazing it helped me so much and was so easy and simple If your a beginner and need help with maybe a YouTube channel or a TikTok account this app is the way to go.
"I love CapCut so much! On other editing apps/games it is very complicated to do. I learned how to use capcut’s editing tricks very quick! I didn’t need any help or tutorials. CapCut helps me with my editing I do for gifts and other things.CapCut can effectsdo,sounds,filter,movement, text and animation.I learned more on the buttons witch was very easy, CapCut tells you where to do that movement or effects. But the only thing is that sometimes there are effects CapCut doesn’t have,so I have to do the hard way. Making the effect my self. I suggest to add more animations because I always use the same things"
"As a Long time Pc (Adobe Premiere ) editor, I finally made the switch!
 
 Before there was Capcut I would have told you from endless downloads on ios and android, that Cell phones video editing was inferior and lacking any real potential of replacing professional PC and Laptops editing.

 I would have said applications will not reach the potential of programs.

  Capcut is the only app to convince me otherwise!

 Heck premiere cannot even motion track.  But this editor, strives in every category, pushing every boundary. Except One, resolution output. 1080p output is the only weakness.

  But this technological archive of an app programming feat Is FREE.
and it is the best there is ( payed app or otherwise ).

  With that said, I submit the following; I have only ever payed for ONE app and it was for Professional control over the stock iPhone video recording functions.

  I would happily pay for my 2nd time ever if … Cap had 4k and 2k format output.

If I could suggest three updatable features it would be:

1. in app frame capture with at least 1080p screen capture output. ( not freeze frame), output frame to gallery. for making video thumbnails. This feature would make this app and all in one solution.

2. External access to music a side from itunes music/ folder. ( export audio from video is an great feature).  Like some of your competitors a file browser function outside iTunes is the final feature to put this amazing app on par with computer program based editors. along with a frame grab feature.

3. Layered video effects per layer.
example: I use the Incredible background remove to create clones. Much like the ability to splice and change parameters of a layered track, this would add video fxs exclusively applied to that layer like those found on the main or top layer video (the magic wand 🪄 icon).

 With these features this app would surpass the work flow only possible across 3 adobe programs. Premiere for editing, Photo shop for thumbnails and After Effects for motion tracking and pre track eccentric video effects. 

 Frankly I argue that the stock materials like stickers and motions base text and animation, has already surpassed they stock materials across all 3 adobe products. 
 Hundreds of costly third party plugins are need just to provide the stock materials within Capcut.
Including; stickers, fonts, sound effects, motion animation, transitions, and video effects. (which are still only available in apps).

  Final mention; 
 The [style] featured (possible on freeze frames) effects like what is referred as picture morphing parallax. (called [3d zoom and 3d zoom pr… within this app). IS INCREDIBLE.
   No other attempts made by programmers have even come close to what is pulled off automatically by these features.
 Same can be said about the [remove background] feature.

  Thank you, from a full time video editor  who’s workflow now consist of %70 percent Capcut, %30 PC."
This app isn’t that bad after all.after I saw legendary edits used and made with CapCut I’m very surprised I’ve been using the wrong all along so this app isn’t so bad if u give it a chance.
I’ve been using CapCut for about 1 year now and I LOVE IT I’m so happy everything is free and u can remove the watermark for free unlike other apps!BUT I have a few suggestions!Mabye add a free QR code area where u can add QR code effects that ppl can make or take from video star my point is I know how to use CapCut but not video star and I would like for u guys to add more video star like effects!!But besides that this is an amazing app 100% recommend
I give it a three star because I don’t have access to my saved sound. I tried on both my android tablet and my iPhone. Same result. Aside from this inconvenience the app is really good.
because its free and it has alot of thing that you can edit and its a great app like i have been using this app for like i don’t remember because it have been years months days and i have been doing alot of capcuts updates and this app is getting really good and there might be somethings u cant find but if u cant find but it could be that u havent done the updates and its just that this app every day is getting better and better i cant imagine what would i do without this app and there might be alot of free apps but just because the apps say its free it doesn’t mean that ween u open the app ur just.gona edit like no it will say u have to pay every month like no capcut it’s better because it free and u can do alot of edits and ween i first got this app i was like what do i do? but then I realized that u had to try ur best and if people dont like ur edits well they’re just hater that hate on every edit that people make and most of my edits go to tik tok❤️❤️❤️❤️i love capcut
I am Absolutely obsessed with CapCut!The Effects are everything and I make the best edits on there!The best thing about it is that it’s completely FREE!!😮‍💨🥴It’s also way better than KineMaster Especially since you have to pay for KineMaster…I’m Just Saying if I ever make a Gacha video they are Fantastic when I use CapCut!!!!My Youtube is Kawaii_sun if you want to see how calcite effected me🥺🤩!!!
I made a video for my YouTube channel testing it out and it made all of my clips terrible. I would call this the worst editor ever. They might look good on some platforms like tikok but try uploading on YouTube or any other social media and the clips look like they are 360p or an even worse quality. Only thing good about the app really is the animations and effects. I wouldn’t recommend this app at all.
"Hello ! I have a issue with CapCut when ever I go in CapCut to make a new video , it’s says : “CapCut requires access to the album for editing and saving videos” idk if this is a glitch or somthing you guys added but please fix this if it is I’m very sad right now because i LOVE CapCut is my favorite editing app I’ve ever had in the past please fix this if this is a glitch and if I have to reinstall my CapCut I’ll very sad because I have made a lot of videos on there that are special to me.Please help."
"I really do like the app. I am able to make edits and post them to YouTube and everything. My only thing is, I wish there was an option to be able to remove background music or sound from a piece of audio or video. If that could be added or implemented in the next update that would be terrific. All around great app though!"
it ok I used cap cut a long time but now it won't let me save the long videos that I make for YouTube and I had to make a whole new video because it wouldn't save & they need to add so new stuff the things they have is getting old I don't want to keep using the same thing the only good thing right now is that it free so I not to mad
Hey CAPCUT please let me confirm! My setttings aren’t working! And I need to edit something I have a YouTube channel and without it I can’t edit
Can U guys pls add self masking like after effects so we can mask our self pls… @capcut
I love it it made my friends so happppyyyyyyyyy PS.make the song we don’t talk about bruno byeeeeeeeee. Ps.I’m a kid
"So i’ve been using capcut for a good couple of years. i’ve notice that the app says 135.4 mb but in the storage option in setting on apple says 3 gb, PLEASE FIX THIS IF YOU CAN!!!!"
I love how there is so much stuff to do I use it for my Roblox edits in YouTube but maybe add some more stuff to it but still THE BeSt EDiTInG ApP Ever
"Every time I add about 3 affects it gets glitch and delete them. Please fix this bug!! Otherwise! Great app! I have made a YouTube channel using this, please subscribe to it if you can! -
Kxlaz-Xdit-Wxrld"
I would like to add that whenever I try to use an audio from tik tok it always says no internet connection or something along the lines of that and the only way to fix that is to delete the app which removes all of the edits I have done.The only good thing about this app is when it works
"This app is amazing. It’s great for making edits (as I am an editor), but I just have 1 suggestion. Add.A.Motion.Blur. kind of like Video Stars so editors who use capcut can make photo dump edits without needing Vsp or TimeCut. Thank you :)"
At first I didn’t know how to use this app but then they made updates to make it easier it’s a really good editing app that you can use to do a lot of stuff with.Overall I give this app a 10/10!
It’s free and you can start editing right away it isn’t that complicated once you get the hang of it. There is plenty on tutorials on YouTube and in the app it self has videos to help you understand what certain tools are for  just tap the “?” Icon and you should see videos .
"It’s very easy to learn as a beginner from CapCut but the thing is,It gets way to easy and you start to not knowing what your doing.So if you are a beginner I recommend starting off on this and if you feel comfortable stay on it and if you dont, get a new editing app0"
I LOOOVVVE THIS APP. YOU CAN MAKE AMAZING VIDEOS AND EDITS FOR FREE AND NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR ANYTHING.OUT OF ALL THE EDITING APPS I HAVE TRIED CAPCUT HAS BEEN THE BEST☺️.
I have a YouTube channel and it blew off and I only used this app and it went great it is soo easy to use! I love it you can get any effect /sound effect add overlays and even more! I have came so far with this app!
"The app is great and I recommend for beginners and people looking for an editor for TikTok or YouTube shorts. First there is an apply to all but could you have an apply to all for the Animation feature for the Text. Number 2 you should have more stock videos like you know I stock videos or anything really. Number 3 I think it would be cool to add stock PHOTOS or in the stickers add photos

I hope this helped!"
"This app, Capcut, is amazing. Amazing. It’s free! And you get most of the features from paid competitors. Yes, some drawbacks (need more fonts) but that’s minor and there’s enough for most occasions. The app is easy to use, and there is so many features!
I used to use video shop for YouTube, but I downloaded this, and I am much happier. Download it! Easy to use and feature packed!"
Is the auto velocity effect only on android? Can someone tell me why my CapCut says can’t adjust current clip? Also can whoever owns CapCut add the auto velocity effect on iPhone too I really want it.
So I see all these thing on YouTube and tiktok where your able to have all these different tabs and your even able to sign in with tiktok and I have none of those and I’m on an iOS 8
I updated CapCut but I didn’t get the slow o everyone else got.Everybody was doing it on android but I have iPhone so yeah.I just need help can anybody respond back and help me with the new update I’m trying to get to 5.0.0 but I have 5.42
"Hello I hope you notice this but you said a smooth slowmo update would happen on march 14 2022 (yesterday) but I didn’t get the update, if you did not add it to the tablet device please do (if your still working on it for tablet just tell me when it’ll be released) thank you! (Also I want a motion blur update)"
"i got this app bc i have seen it all over tiktok and stuff and it works really well i make edits for my bf randomly and send it to her and this has help me a lot! thanks cap cut!!!
❤️"
So this is a good app for editing but there is a glitch for photos.When you go to add a photo or picture into the project it says you have none.And I know this is a glitch because the photos were there and then they were gone.Please fix this.
It’s so good I make my edits like 24/7 365 on here like omg and it has great quality!✌️
"So, I definitely like this app. I’ve been using it for maybe nearly a year now to make videos for my YouTube channel. I’ve been able to make really good animations with this. However there is one thing that I wish this thing had that would make this so much easier. I make FNF-based animations so there’s a lot of looping, specifically for stuff like the idle animations and parts that repeat. It would be very helpful if there was an option to select multiple photos and copy them so I wouldn’t have to put more work into doing the same part. Other than that I think it’s a great app"
"Can you make the overlays stick with the clip like the stickers please, so when i move my clip the overlays moves with it exactly how the stickers do so on the app, because it takes a lot of effort if I have more than one overlay and I want to remove certain clips or shorten them after I added the overlays it takes actually hours to do so because I edit my YouTube videos on the app, this app will be so perfect if you guys add this thing to it, it will laterally save us more time and will let us only use the app and not other apps with it, also if you guys can fix the Arabic issue because when I write in Arabic actually the words gets typed in backwards so I can never type in Arabic if I wanted to add a title or subtitles ❤️ rating: (9/10)"
I started making YouTube videos NeededTo edit themThis is great for me because I am a beginner 5Stars!
"When I got the app again I tried using the TikTok audio it said I had no internet connection when I did. I look up YouTube videos to how to fix it but they they really said is to use a a vpn. If I really need to use a vpn on an app that gave me the option before hand to use the audios, the app is just not worth it to me anymore. Sorry."
I love this app with all my heart and I think it needs to be the number one app please write to my comment…..so basically when I try to make my text glow (which I know how to it doesn’t work I tired millions of YouTube videos to see what is wrong (what I did wrong.  AND I DID NOTHING WRONG oops caps sorry I am a kid and maybe you can fix it please -love by fan
"I use it for tiktok videos and youtube videos, and it’s good quality for tiktok making it. I also love love LOVE how they made velocity so we don’t have to spend hours on velocity. I also like that diamond star thing that you can you to make charecters walk! Amazing app."
"This app is amazing. It’s perfect for my YouTube channel because it allows me to make editing look so much better than IMovie. And it’s all free! I only ask that you not pull a Spotify and make it cost money in the future, as it will definitely ruin the app. Overall great app though!"
"I really use capcut a lot because it’s really good and easy to use , but at first it wasn’t ,so I had to use YouTube to help me ,and now I am a pro at this , this really and might get me to have many views and I love this app so much but it some sort got deleted and now I can’t download it but I do really recommend this app because it’s really cool but it might get really confusing, just go look at YouTube, it can help solve it and you will get to know lots of new things on capcut and the more you use it or practice you will be a master at editing on capcut ,I am just hoping one day I can finally download it back again because I love it sooooo much , please use this app!!!"
omg ok so I have been using CapCut for 2 years in a row and I love it so much I have a YouTube channel and I edit my videos like about every day and I love it 😻 so I promise this edit app is the best one
"This app is awesome and I use it all the time to edit random videos I’ve taken or to make cool montages or even just to edit a pic to make it more exciting! U can add music, sound effects, filters, camera transitions, text, and even add a different background (without even having to use a green screen)! This app is perfect for everything whether it’s to edit a video and upload to YouTube or TikTok or just to find something to do while ur bored it’s a perfect choice and it’s all 100% free! Do urself a favor and download this app, even if ur not really into this kinda stuff usually, it’s always good to have just in case!"
"this app is so amazing for edits! I love it so much. So many things you can do with this app! It’s awesome! It’s awesome for your YouTube edits, tik tok edits, ect! Totally recommend."
I have been looking for an app that would be free and this is best the filters voice changers the way you can add your own audio you can also export them to tiktok YouTube Facebook I think. And send your edits to your friends!
"It’s a Really good editing app to use for YouTube,Tiktok and more, And if you have a YouTube channel You can use CapCut And I think it will help your YouTube channel , I don’t see any problems in this app, It’s perfect!"
"Idk if this is happening to anyone else but when I save an edit I made to my camera roll, the music and the pictures don’t line up.and it’s so frustrating.I’ve tried everything,I’ve tried deleting pictures, using a different app to record things, deleting apps.nothing works."
"When I downloaded this app for the first time it was fine, but now it’s just starting to be a pain in my butt. It would make ten thousand excuses for you to not use this app first is the “insignificant storage” now is not letting me edit any videos that I can upload to my channel I’m slowly starting to not like this app anymore… (I had to give it five stars or else it would hide my review)"
Could you maybe make a place to search videos like YouTube ones and we can save them? It would be great since I’m trying to make a green screen.
I am not an expert at editing.But it is still very good.So if I were you I’d download this app.
This app is amazing when I first started I thought it was going to be FILLED with adds but no I was VERY wrong it had no adds and then I thought it was going to be like HEY DO YOU WANNA BUY THIS 999999.999 DOLLER SUBSCRIPTION and Same thing nothing so everything is literally free you should get it
So I been using capcut for a year and I been using the graphs thing and when I go to use it it seems to be not working like how I remember it was working if this is a bug can you please fix it.No rush if it is it’s just werid to me and if it’s a new update it’s really cool just graphs
"CapCut is great for editing making vids and all but one of my problems are is that ,whenever you want to add a gif you can go to stickers but it doesn’t always have the ones you want so if i do want to add one I have to go to google and find the gif and download it so it is kinda annoying to do so I was gifs options.Andsecond thing is sometimes in overlay you cannot get the pictures options and only video options.Andthe third thing is that whenever I try to make an edit audio and I get the audio but it gives very low options to edit it it is mostly like speed,fade,delete and whenever I give the speed slower it doesn’t come out as smooth and I would really like a few audio edit upgrades like backgrounds music,reverb,underwater,and more like that And that and the fourth thing is that whenever I remove the green screen with sensitivity but the results don’t come out as good and plus give a drawing option with a nice amount of types of brushes so Please fix that if you can is all I have to say and I really appreciate your work but adding the things I told about would be ELITE and I highly respect and appreciate it.That’s all I have"
Ok so it’s pretty good but every single time I need to do a YouTube video it’s like 25 minutes long and then it takes out my audio of me talking I hate it please fix this it’s so annoying and when that happens I have to download it again i really don’t like this
"CapCut is a great editing app for videos. I use it all the time, it has many cool transitions and effects! The effects might just be my favorite about the app! CapCut also has very good aEsThEtIc music for background. CapCut also has good fonts! The only thing that I don’t really like about the app is keyframes. The keyframes are very hard to use. I understand perfectly how to use them, but my object always moves around wear I don’t put it and it slides a lot. There are tutorials on YouTube showing how to different stuff! I found out how to do a rainbow outline and it works very well! Love the app I recommend the app very much"
"This app is like the best editing app I’ve ever seen. Everything in this app is amazing, and everyone should be downloading it. The auto velocity made my edits 100000% better. This app just gets better and better by the millisecond."
"I am new to CapCut but I am getting better at editing my YouTube videos. (My YouTube channel is Annie Bananie_Playz#roadto35subs) CapCut has lots of effects and I like that you can also put a frame around your video but, if you zoom in, you can’t see the frame. That’s something you could work on. I like the filters and all the transitions like the glass break. I think that you could also add more like instructions on how to do it at the beginning because I had to explore it and that toke a little while. Other than that I think this is a good editing app for people to use!"
"Me and my friend have tried a lot of apps for editing such as KineMaster, vn, iMovie, FilmoraGo  and the list goes on. We have a YouTube channel *if you are reading this sub to tres prod* and we post sports highlight edits. CapCut provides many different effects, transitions, and animations. 

*I have a few effect requests, which are projected custom text so when you add the effect you can change the text, a blue shockwave because the other one is getting overused, and lastly and shake animations like after effects

			Thank you*"
"I love this it helps me make such cool videos! If you want to see some of them my YouTube channel is called sky pheonix check it out if you want! Also I give this app a rating 1000000,0000000,000000,000000,0000000 out of ten"
"Highly recommend this app if your new to editing like me. It is super easy to use and easy to understand how to navigate through the transitions, effects and edits. If you get stuck you can easliy look up a tutorial on Youtube to understand."
"I love this app. Right now I’m making text to speech. Anyways, I’ve never found anything wrong with this app and I just adore it! Btw, my brother has a YouTube channel called GlowCat. Make sure to go check it out please. And thank you if you do."
"So I have just started YouTube and my friend recommended using CapCut so I tried it, when I first used it Overall it was very easy to edit and I did not have any problems. But when I finished my first edit and downloaded it, I had to delete everything to download it and post it and it also took a very long time to download. But this is one of the best editing apps I have used and there are some of my suggestions."
This so is very good I had a video and wanted to edit it so I typed up edit and I seen this app so I downloaded it and added the video and added edit.The edits looks really good with this app capcut if a very good app for editing.
With out this app I would of never followed my dreams i will repay you I swear when I grow bigger.thank you so much😌
This is the most amazing editor app I have ever used! I have been using it since 2020! It’s an amazing app but the full storage thing is kinda annoying.But besides that it’s amazing!
I love tjatvthrush
"I have been using CapCut for a few months and I really like it because it is free no money.no premium!!, except for one thing. Whenever I try to do slowmotion it lags and doesn’t have good quality. But I do recommend this app!!"
"after effects > 
- namikaze.aep"
This app is great for editing a lot of things but what I normally use this for gotcha.Ot is great for that but I think it needs a few more things but over all it is a great app to use.
I make YouTube videos - Olivia Lamora- and I edit with this they come out so cute and amazing without having big ads and watermarks!! Thank you CapCut!
"I’ll admit, I see why this app has such good ratings. I thought this app was overrated but it’s pretty good for its ratings and reviews. The animations the music, the sounds, everything is really high quality for a free app. My only problems with the app is that 1 I’ve seen a lot of people on YouTube are able to look at other peoples edits on the app. I’m not sure how to access that. And the chroma key, when I do it on a certain color it does it for another color as well. I think the issue might be with the intensity. Other wise, it’s a really good app."
Yo.you made a god edit for me?
Very easy to learn. I like editing YouTube videos and it’s perfect
"Honestly it’s one of the best aqua I have had and it’s so cool you can do so much on there like make videos, edit things, and even edit your own videos it’s a really fun app and I think you can enjoy it too but there are some difficulties but from now to when I was a beginner I think I kind of masters this app. You can also post your CapCut videos on YouTube, TikTok, and maybe even instagram. I totally think this app is worth it."
"So, recently I started YouTube (1 year ago). And, lately I’ve been using KineMaster. On the other hand my friend has been using capcut. I don’t know but when I saw her edits, it was so good. I downloaded capcut and I didn’t know what to do at first but she taught me and I watched videos on what to do on capcut. Once I got better at it I started posting even more. But, I saw that some people been using other apps and they have animation. I loved the animation so much! I tried putting 3 animations in together by splitting one picture / video and.. it didn’t look as good: although, the app is very easy to use like what it says. 
Now, I kind of want features to come in and I love the new effects they added but I just want more animations. Not just effects, but animation. I also want them to add this button where it says “Change Image of buttons” I want this button to change the picture of the “Create New” , “Shortcut” and “Camera”. Now, I really want my capcut to look really kawaii and cute. Although, i don’t want to edit it because that’s gonna also get rid of the words so, I really want these features to
be in capcut. I’m sure a lot of people would want to have more animations into the app and some people would want to also customize the buttons. 💗 But overall, the app is really good!

(Please respond back: I need answers!)"
Anyone want smoke dm me @whoskofii on instagram I’ll whoop up on u🥱
I love this app I always use it to edit it’s not complicated to use at all you don’t even have to watch a tutorial it’s just so easy!  I also use this app to upload a photo on YouTube I don’t have 500 subscribers so I can’t just upload a picture so I put my photos in here to make a video and then I upload that this app is the app that in the future will help me edit my YouTube videos really good like others Do you can also put clip together in this app which is really popular I think this app is the app I will never delete I love this app sometimes there are bugs but they are easy to fix alot of times you just have to get out of it and get back in I can always count on this app to help me with me edit love it!!!!!!
"Found App by “Created by Ella” young YouTuber. It’s free, easy to use, and kills time. Fun app making Music Picture Slideshows for Apple Videos and YouTube."
"This app is amazing! I use it for all my edits and its a good app for beginners but theres only one problem.And its about the quality, when I adjust it sometimes its not smooth and I’m looking for something that can greatly increase quality on videos.so this app is great but only just one problem for me.Thank you:)"
"I really loved this app for a few weeks. I was using to edit my YouTube videos and I never had an issue with it until today. Randomly it started freezing and and now allowing me to edit any further. My video is less than 30 minutes long and I have plenty of storage. I tried closing the app and restarting it. And restarting my phone as well. But it just keeps happening and now I can’t continue with my video. Idk how to fix this, someone please help."
"I was looking for video editing apps to start my youtube channel, but all of them costed money, and “pro features used” would come  up exporting the video. But CapCut, no no no.. it let me have freedom and creativity while editing my video! It had so many cool features FOR FREE!! I am very suprised with the outcome and results of this app. Thank you so so much for making my video editing experience better!"
"I've never been this appreciated for an app.100% and no watermark are on the whole new level.Thank You creator and looking forward to the best new features in the future.Well Done.

2022 REQUEST : Can we have Myanmar Fonts available please?"
Amaizing for making ticktocks and for YouTube but pls more effects like for the lighting lighting effects and bling and for us to use the same background from a photo or video thanks
"It is the best free software I have ever found and I use it for YouTube and YouTube shorts. 
It is wonderful the only thing I would like to see is music editing to that would be amazing even if it wasn’t that great of a software. Thank you for reading!"
"Excelente app para editar nuestros videos caseros y gratis! Creo trae más opciones que iMovie! Muchas gracias a los desarrolladores.

Update: 30/1/2022
Hello, it is not a problem or error that I want to tell you about.  I would like that in future updates of the application they add the possibility of being able to import audio clips directly from the iOS Files application, it is a function that I think is useful and necessary.  The VN app allows you to do this, so it would be great if CapCut included it as well.  Greetings and thank you very much for the work you do."
Good
"If there is anything I get made about it’s when things don’t work or are glitchy. I really want you to fix it and make sure it’s fixed! I can’t even play it or upload it to YouTube! I get mad easily too, and this does not help! Overall it’s fine nothing much/different. It’s just that it won’t play like you SAID it would. And, it was MADE to play a video or to make on to watch and play. As a small YouTuber, this does not help that I can’t even make a video to upload! I want to see my finished result. Please please please fix this! It just makes things 10x harder and makes videos much harder to make and watch! Please!"
Yes it’s a very good editing app it helps me with all my TikTok’s YouTube videos etc.But when I delete most of my apps it still says phone storage I hate it o deleted half of my photos and still said phone storage I hope it doesn’t do it again to me because I deleted half of my phone I am not trying to be a Karen I am sorry if I hurt your feelings but whoever wants to get an editing app but the other one make you pay money for things get capcut it’s free and amazing!Thank you have a Blessed day
"More filter options, please I need a way to make videos deep-fried sometimes.
Also, add support for gifs."
It soo good I like it for tick tock  it’s soo cool it makes your own videos better than the old ones it’s like you are an editor like a YouTube or a movie editor
"This app to be honest,IS AMAZING LIKE LEMME TELL U K SO-in my opinion this app is really good especially for beginners. And yea like if ur a Roblox YouTuber for example CapCut will be great to like help u edit and stuff (sub to me on YouTube my channel is Simply Flame) but today it was kinda laggy ig like when I tried making a new project it told me try again later and sm about my internet..I’m 100% sure there was nothing wrong with my internet Like all other apps were working so that means my internet was fine.Um so yeah basically if they could fix this problem that would be great! 👍🏻"
"My friend who makes edits for YouTube showed me this quite a while ago, and I’ve been in love with it since. It has amazing features and it’s incredibly easy to use. I definitely recommend this to any editors because of how amazing this is :) great work developer!"
"u should add me on snap, ayeitsizzy3"
"I love it. I use it for YouTube, It works perfectly! 

Better than Adobe Premiere Pro!"
"Once I got this app I was confused on how it works but then it was super fun once I found out! No watermarks, no ads, and COMPLETELY FREE!! It has so many effects to choose from and it’s good quality. I would definitely recommend this app. I even started a YouTube channel and posted edits made my CapCut. Hope this helps!! :)"
"THIS GAME IS AMAZING, no adds no nothing! U don’t have to buy anything and u don’t have to watch an add 24/7 I really love this, it makes me happy and I can edit my videos and post it on YouTube! Thanks a lot man. This game is not rigged stupid are nothing! Thanks man"
"I love this app so much I’ve had it for a while and I use it all the time but there is one small problem. I like to make edits using the app and I put my username in white with the opacity to 10 so it’s just visible, but I can no longer change the opacity. The bar to edit the opacity it’s blacked out so I can’t use it."
"I use this for my YouTube and tiktok and it’s the best editing app ever. No label, no adds, and good quality app"
It’s great but.... I NEED REAL MUSIC!!!!!!!!!!!! So we need real music not fake music but it’s good ෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆ¯\_(°_°)_/¯¯\_(°_°)_/¯
This app is very simple I could even make a YouTube video if I wanted. I’ve always stuck to writing but because of this app I so simple I’m so happy. Give it a shot seriously!! I use it for my Tiktoks @yourdarksideguide
"So I play a lot of roblox and stuff like that and I see people on YouTube making edits and I saw one person used CapCut to make their edits. So I decided to download it and try it out myself. All I can say was that I was AMAZED. It was so easy, and a little time consuming depending on how long you edit your video. But my first video turned out amazing!!! I currently have 21 edits so far and they’re amazing! So I recommend you to download this because a lot of people use this app for edits. So yeah! Hopes this helps!!"
This app is really good I always use this is takes some time but it helps me make youtuber videos fast and in peace it always helps me to make my videos and it doesn’t even table that long I give it a 5 stars and 10/10.And it even let me take the audio super fast and I can make the videos before my charge runs even thought I am an iPhone user😊
This is kid appropriate it’s great. And if your kid is. Creative tell them this is the app for them it’s a great app me and my famliy love this app you will be so interested in this app there is so many cool things to do on the app like filters and more so people GET THiS APP it’s great if you want to make a YouTube channel you can edit your videos through here it’s amazing and awesome so get the app pls you will fall in love with it!!
I think this app should connect with Spotify so I can have actual good music because your thing to connect with tic tok does not work other then getting the video on there I can’t have my sounds on there
Capcut it is pretty cool and I can make good edits.I also connected it to TikTok.But it keeps saying no internet when adding TikTok sounds.And keep having to uninstall then reinstall the app.
"I love this app! The only thing about it is the music. I wish that you could search up songs. Let’s say I wanted to do a video with a tiktok song in it. I would have to screen record from YouTube and imported in there without hearing it. It makes it hard to know timing. As of I’m old enough to have Tiktok but I’m not allowed. That’s the only thing that I would like to have because everything if perfect in that app! Also if you import a sound for the video can it give us an option to put it along with the video or have it separately when the video is done. That’s the in,y things that I ask for ! Again other than that the app is amazing TOTALY RECCIMEND!"
"This app is the most recommended editing app (please read this whole review) my sister first recommended it to me and I thought it would be a boring app where all that you could do was take vids 

But I started a YouTube channel and I used it for one video and everyone liked it! 🅈🄾🅄 🅂🄷🄾🅄🄻🄳 🄳🄾🅆🄽🄻🄾🄰🄳 🅃🄷🄸🅂 🄰🄿🄿."
"I really love Capcut, its overall a great editing app.

My only suggestion is about music
What i kinda wish for is to get music from ITunes, Apple Music, Spotify, or we could even transfer the whole song

But overall its really great and I recommend youtubers, streamers, or anyone who makes videos to get this app!"
"This is a pretty good app for beginners! Before I used to edit with KineMaster but ever since I came across capcut on tiktok I have improved a lot with my edits! The only problem is it kept saying I had no more storage, I would delete so many photos and videos sometimes even apps and it would still say I had no storage.to fix it I had to delete it and redownload the app! Here are some things I want on capcut that I think would make the app better: smooth slowmo,more fonts,more than one animation on the fonts,a option for good quality,more effects,and more animations! So in conclusion I would say if you’re a beginner I think this app would fit you! It’s a pretty good app and easy to understand once you start! So I would recommend this for beginners! If anyone is seeing this have a good day/night !! <33"
OMG THIS APP IS AMAZING BC I CAN ACTUALLY MAKE GOOD EDITS AND EDIT VIDEOS FOR MY CHANNEL! THANK YOU FOR THIS WONDERFUL APP! ALSO My YouTube Is GiioGriss
"I edit all of my videos with this app!
It’s so great you can do everything you need but it’s super easy One thing I wish they would do that was add a YouTube shorts feature just like they did with TikTok"
10/10 would recommend I love this app because I’m a beginner and I can make so many different things and express all my ideas
Please put Amazon music in there I always wanted to put music my favorite in there 🥺😭
Pls fix this is that i am a YouTube and I make videos but 8 ran out of room so I got rid of screenshots from the video and then randomly my video just was all black plz fix!
"Hi, at first I loved the app because it was free and I make roblox edits so it was awesome but it started taking up so much storage that I had to quit YouTube. Anyway you could get this fixed?"
Can y’all put it to were you can import the vid on YouTube
"Overall, I really do love CapCut for editing videos, and the photo affects as well as pretty much all the other neat tools and tricks. But the one thing I do find a bit annoying is how you view all your projects. And what I mean to say, is I wish that there was a way you could collect all your projects into some sort of groups, or folders. As a way to organizes them I guess is what I’m saying. And I know it’s not something big, but I just feel like it would make searching for a specific project a lot easier. 

But again, it’s just a small minor detail. Other then that, I love the app."
"Capcut is the best
Capcut is the best
Capcut is the best
Capcut is the best"
I hope if y’all see this get the app it’s so good for beginners in editing I just started and is very pleased this app doesn’t take up all of your storage and is great recommend 1000/10
"The app is great and does a lot of the things I wanted to be able to do, but I have two suggestions - there needs to be an option to use music from apps like Spotify, Apple Music, and Pandora because I think that a lot of songs from music apps like those can be really good in edits and videos but we can’t use those. The other suggestion I have is that there needs to be lots of other stock videos for different things because some people (like myself) can’t get the videos or pictures they want because they simply don’t have access to it. If you took these things into consideration that would be great."
I LOOOVVVEEEEE this editing app!!!!!! I can make so many good videos for FREE!!!!! I can use it for YouTube or maybe just to make an aesthetic video for my friends! You can do SO MUCH with this!!! So if you want to make good videos I really suggest getting this!!!!!!!!!! It’s not even hard to use. You just pick the video you want to edit then add whatever you want! My friend suggested this for my YouTube channel so I got it and LOVE it! Um so glad that there is a free editing app like this that I can use!
Well cap cut is easy to use and is so easy to understand but I wish there was more effects and filters also adjusting is kinda hard and I’m a beginner so this is a mostly great app but could be more and only a few things are bad also i lOVE THis app just add how to use it on there to cause then you have to dive into YouTube tutorials or something  on google and it’s great and FREE recemend this to you if looking at this whole thing                                                                        -random right now 9 year old you’ll never hear from again
CapCut is so cool in CapCut you put a lot of pictures in one second it all looks so cool after you put it all together.this app is the best that I have seen I hope you get it.
"I’m not upset just I tried saving this video and sending it on YouTube. And it wouldn’t save. It would always say I have to clean up storage. I don’t have that much storage but it kept spamming the message. I’m sorry but please fix this app cause it won’t stop I’m just trying to be nice. 

-Scarlett"
It is so easy I found out how to do it in a few minutes! Now I can make Gacha vids (i don’t have a YouTube channel) so easily!
"This app is very good for tiktok anime edits, but theres just one thing. 

It Takes Up A Lot Of Space
I know that having a ton of stuff on your phone would mean you have to delete a ton of photos, apps, and other things. Though it’s that this is one of the apps that had a lot of MB and GB. I had to redownload Capcut twice due to low disk space."
I was excited to edit a video of mine for my YouTube (iiFlowerbeanii) after not posting for awhile the app keeps saying that something went wrong when downloading my video
"I don’t like to make these things long and all I have to say is that CapCut is great app😆 it is so easy to work with the to figure out what to use! You can shorten the video, add effects, add filters, transitions and way more! If you want to figure out how to use it better and improve your editing skills go on YouTube and there is a lot of great videos to help you out! How to edit yourself, others, video game characters and etc. I would highly recommend this app and CapCut is the only editing app I use anymore 🙂 DOWNLOAD IT KNOW! IT IS AWESOME! Best app ever for editing! I really do hope there are more transition options in the future though"
"I love CapCut! It’s easy to use and has nice effects, audio, and stickers- it’s also very smooth! But the things that’s wrong with it; Sometimes, my capcut says that I have insufficient storage. When I don’t. It forces me to either reinstall or delete two to three apps until it doesn’t say it’s full anymore. It also has lag problems on Motorola G (Android) phones. It lags a lot on there and sometimes cuts off the audio. I don’t know if the device just isn’t suitable for CapCut or it’s the developers intention, but those are all my problems. Great app!"
This app is very fun! It has filters songs and lots more. I can edit my YouTube videos know. I love the filters and the backgrounds. There is a bad thing about the song it should have some songs with words clean songs. I heard of it from my sister! I downloaded it and edit some videos. They where so good! I like doing voice over to it’s fun to talk over or as a different person in your videos. You can even post videos to TikTok. I would get this app if you want to edit pictures or videos!
"I’m so made right now, cause on CapCut, their is a button called a “key frame” and the key frame keys moving un-controllably! I was trying to post a video on my device, but the key frame wouldn’t let me edit that post, and that is what this app is made for. I wasreally raging   and upset when the happened, but other than that, I give this app CapCut, a 5/5 star rating. Please please pretty please with cherries on top check this out CapCut. Thanks for the time at reading this message. -Kittylover052011 (just put my Roblox username )"
WHY DOES IT TAKE UP 995.8 MB ON MY PHONE WHEN I ONLY HAVE ONE 20 SECOND EDIT. Other then that love the app.
implement landscape editing
Hii when I was looking for a editing app I saw this app  I was like it might be a good app but it was better then good.mal though I think three should be more things to edit with. Like more blurs  filters and more.
"So when i first got it it was perfect!!!it was always go edit how i wanted it.and it was really good effects but here are the things that need to be added and fixed.
1.please fix the promblems i was moving my vids by itself its weird
2.add more effects please.they are kinda boring there not bad but not good and they are all the SaMe!!!!
3.add more live vids.they are all the freakin same and BOOOoRINGGggGGG!!!!!!
4.add more sounds/songs they are all the same and kinda boring if you would atleast just add 40+ more and will be great:)
🥰✨

Sorry if its long"
"It’s a amazing app, I recommend this for you if you just started.it updates with more effects and animations and tools.It’s very helpful for editing, however, it’s only the starting step for editing.It’s good for a beginner and learning to edit, but if your a pro and want to expand the limits this is not really the thing, it’s just the starter.But it’s a very very good starter.If you haven’t edited, download this app right now!!Some small bugs is when you a lot of graphs it starts to get REALLY REALLY glitchy.I really want you guys to fix that problem, using key frames help so much.The effects are very nice, and your updates keep on getting better.It’s very easy and simple to understand.It has everything labeled and set in a very memorable way.Apps like alight motion and etc. are very hard to understand and it takes a lot of time.for me, CapCut was Alonso a bit hard at first but I got a hand with it very fast.I recommend doing edits on CapCut for a decent amount of time and then move to alight motion, it’s very hard to understand but has more availability’s.CapCut, I would really like you to add the same recourses as alight motion and put it in a very simple way.You app overall is almost perfect and best app for beginners.Thank you so much, I’m really good at making edits on your platform and outside.its all because you this app."
"YouTube tutorials show a menu at the bottom of the app that allows you to search for templates. This is missing and I’m not sure why. Maybe it’s a bug? I also do not have Tik Tok to search for templates.

Update (Dec. 2021):
Developers have stated that templates (bottom menu) are only available in some regions. I live in the US and don’t have access. That was the greatest thing about the app but it’s useless now."
ok cap-cut is overall pretty good but i hate it that there is not really good songs and i'm using a tablet that does not allow me to screen record for songs and i get so frustrated finding songs so i really want that you have more songs that are on youtube or we can find songs we like and not import them cuz it is frustrating to use no songs i keep trying to figure something out but their is nothing i can do so pls do that I'm begging have a nice day.
This is dog poop
like this is the best app for starters of editing.the app is free to download no purchase no ads very good I like free stuff when. I started editing it was September or August 😀
"。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。
Im Going To Try To Make This Review Easy To Read!:)

Ok so i think this is an AWESOME app its such a fun app, its so fun that i just try making random videos just so i can use the app!I 100% recommend this app its very entertaining to use and for people who dont wanna pay for “PREMIUM TO USE MUSIC” or “BUY PREMIUM SO YOU CAN HAVE A BETTER EXPERIENCE” this app is all free! And if people out there aren't trying to waste their money on some app then get CapCut! I absolutely L•O•V•E this app!

••••••••

You can use this app for so many different things but heres the part for my recommendations! 

RECOMMENDATIONS SECTION~~~

So I recommend that team CapCut to add more music options kinda like Spotify and I know thats a lot to ask for so maybe just like some more popular music! And maybe some old 90s music to! 

ENDING•

Thank you so much for reading my Review i hope this helped you decide whether you want to get this app or not! Thank you guys and thank you CapCut for creating such an amazing app-"
"So, i like to use the songs from sour (by Olivia rodrigo) so, here’s my hack. I use Spotify, and if u do two, try this hack:

Step 1: download a screen recording app
Step 2: start recording, and play your selected song
Step 3: then, stop the recording when the song/songs are over.
Step 4: trim the clip to where you cut off the time at the end and the parts with no music.
Step 5: then, save clip to your photos.
Step 6: then, go into cap cuts, then press music, then go to songs, and press “your sounds”. And then, press extract sound, then you add the video, then ur done!

Any way, cap cut is a great app, and i would like it if u could name ur sound downloads. Ty!"

"I love this app so much! I’m a beginning editor, and I do it as a hobby, so I don’t have much experience and I don’t want to spend a bunch of money on expensive apps or expensive equipment, so this is amazing! The only thing I would change would be to add more songs and sounds to choose from. I know you can upload songs to your edits, but I don’t know how to do that and since I don’t have Spotify or Apple Music, I’m not able to do that. So I end up having to record my own voice, which is fine, but I’m no professional singer. All in all, this app is amazing and I totally recommend to beginner editors!"
Basically lazy review bc im too lazy to write. So basically when I didn’t know capcut was a thing I used iMovie. iMovie wasn’t that great because it didn’t have much stuff + no updates and then when I found this app I was amazed by the reviews and I looked on YouTube to see if it was a good app and people said it was so I downloaded the app and THIS WAS SO MUCH BETTER THAN IMOVIE! Like it’s the best app ever you should download it and there’s so much effects and stuff and I am just amazed chef kiss try out the app it’s super good download it!
CapCut taught me how to edit videos and now it makes my life a whole lot easier. If there was one thing I would change on the app is to enhance the audio choices. I love the audio choices there are now but I feel like there could be more. I also like how you can access your songs you have on a playlist or just a song in general. One thing you could do to change the sound choices is to add a search bar. An editor could search for a specific song instead of look at all of your choices. Plus if an editor has a time limit on the video like say they have 7 hours to complete the edit and send it back to the creator l just going to the search bar and finding a specific song it would save the editor some crucial time. I love CapCut because it lets your creative juices flow with no limit. Before I downloaded the app and I was reading some reviews. A couple of reviews said that the storage on the app wasn’t very good. I have not yet experienced that problem but I do throw out some of my older edits. Thank you CapCut for taking the time and reading this review and to others I hope you found it helpful!
"I use this app almost every day just for fun. Random edits, cute scenery, tiktok, YouTube. Anything. Really easy to use. So many cute affects and filters. This app is great for beginners and pros. 😍❤️"
"This is the best editor ever because you can literally do text you can do effects it’s so crazy and so easy to use! Check out my channel here on YouTube: MarshMellysLT!
That’s my channel to go see my videos on roblox and using this app. It’s very fun and easy

You should try it!
Ty for reading.
I hope it helped!"
For the next update that you guys have could you guys please add to where we could have accounts. Like it would save everything that we’ve done prior to y’all adding accounts but all we would have to do is make a username and password and it would save all of our projects. I just think I’d be a good idea in case someone broke their phone and they didn’t save any of their edits they could just login on a different device.
"I’m pleased with Capcut. I got it a couple of days ago and now I’m totally addicted. I taught myself; it’s a great beginner app. I highly recommend it for beginners and if you ever get stumped or want more “pizazz” just search things up on YouTube. 
Also, pro tip, if you want an audio, screen record it then extract it into your video.
Have fun creating!"
I use this app everyday for my YouTube videos and it’s absolutely amazing nothing costs money and no ads it’s the best app in my opinion 5000/5
"Hello, I LOVE this app so much. It’s not like KindMaster, let me tell ya, but this app should be #1 on the App Store! I’m not joking! Download this app, after your first video, ❗️BOOM❗️ Amazed. I wanted to try out the app and see what it does, Bc why not?, and I made my first video and this is what happened:
*Goes out of app* 
*Sees KindMaster*
*Gets rid of that Rinky-Dinky App* 
Me: “All done!”
That’s why you should try it!

now...for the suggestions!

1. Can you add TikTok songs? I have to go on YouTube, record the song, and put it in the video. 

2. Can you have a tutorial on how to add green screens? I have found some on YouTube and I liked them but I don’t know how to get them on the app.

3. Can you add anime voices. I can’t speak like any anime character and I was just wondering. (If you don’t know what anime is, it is Japan shows.)

4. (This is not a suggestion) Anyways, Iove this app, like I said, It should be on the top of all apps! Thank you 🙏!"
For me my editing apps I see most of the time I have to pay.But I love this app . It has great things to edit with and it’s a great start for people that don’t edit or edit much.
IT IS FREE AND VERY EASY TO FIND WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR! This was my first editing app and still is and I have grown so much. I really hope it stays free!!!
"Ok so I had this app for awhile and it’s amazing!! I love it so much.One day I went to go to my phone to create a video on CapCut and it said I had to “insufficient storage”, and it said I had to delete some photos so I did as so but then it still said the same thing and then I got annoyed and deleted almost all my photos and videos and all videos on CapCut and I have only 10 photos and 1 video! And it STILL said the same thing I’m so mad because I made a really good video so I don’t wanna delete the app but it won’t let me enter the video bc I still have to much! This makes me very mad pls if you can do something about this-"
Works best for YouTube videos
"Konnichiwa! Im very inpressed with this app. I am a professional editor on this now, and i only started a few months ago! It was eversense i was watching one of my favorite youtubers that they revealed they edit with CapCut so i decided to try it! And wow 😮! Its amazing i really love this, ive been wanting to create a chanel on youtube and this is the perfect editting app for it! Im just very inpressed!!!! Bye (If your wondering what konnichiwa is is hello in Japanese, im Japanese.)"
So currently I’m trying to upload a YouTube video and I can’t bc my storage is full but what else do u want me to do I had to delete some of my photos and videos just to edit the video and now I have to delete apps and photos and stuff just to export it this should not be ok us youtubers and editors should be able to do our thing without deleting our creations I know y’all have to fix this right now and I mean right now as I’m writing this review I deleted like 54 things to try to get this code up for my viewers and I still can’t so y’all need to fix that problem do better
It’s a great app it sooooooo good it great for beginners I love it but there’s three things I wish you can fix’s I play Gacha life make videos so I make a lot of clips like 0.1 long but it glitches and if I put a lot in one video the video is super slow or weird so I have to put clips and then add them all together. But then it’s the overlay when you make a move I want it to be slow yes I know how to make it slow but it only goes one angel I want a character to walk up and down I just walks straight and then I have to give up on that video.and here’s something to add:maybe make a place where you can edit audio like merge audio add sound effects to go to then next song.But other than that its great 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Okay.I always loved this app and still do and it helps a lot with my YouTube channel of gacha :))) I highly recommend this
"This game is just…..well, awesome! I’ve been using it since September and I have some things that it keeps doing.#1: overlays. Just a second ago I was making my edit and when I did the keyframe I was trying to get it to go down a little. But it just went all over the place! Of course I was a little mad, but it was doing good before that! Maybe you could help with that? #2:chroma key. We all know what chroma key does. It removes the color  from green screens! It’s often used for overlays. But when I used it, it looked, well… like an old piece  of paper  from 1832 that was cut out. I used ibisPaint x to edit it, and it looked like what I said. (No offense to the creators of ibisPaint x!) maybe you could make the overlays that were edited from ibisPaint x look a little more newer. Now to things I suggest. I really think your should make a little drawing button to those who can’t get ibisPaint or ibisPaint x. Next thing I think you should add is pet stickers and hand stickers, and a custom sticker button a recording button instead of just uploading videos so we can save storage. That’s all I suggest. Overall, this app is AMAZING.  Without this i would be a TERRIBLE editor. 5 star always!"
"Hi,I’ve have been working on a new intro for YT but I left the then my storage was full when I came back and I worked SO hard on that intro it made me sad.But the game is great and all, its 
just is SO annoying.So I think some updating would be very help-ful.i don’t know any other editing apps.So plz update.But over all it’s pretty great."
"I have been looking for a app that has the capability to be just as good as the ones on PC for my Youtube Channel, and i haven't found one better than CapCut, easy to use, same abilities as filmora and more complex editing software unlike most other editing software like IMovie, just make sure to have enough storage, other than that i strongly recommend this app."
So everything is good but the text can you make one where it is a flame and can change the colors and stuff like as a example search up on YouTube blue face edit #shorts pls and thank you!!….!!
"This app is amazing, it has all the features you need and is completely free. It is really good for animation and things and i would 1000000% recommend!"
"If your looking for a video editor that’s totally free, this is the one! Just delete the watermark at the end (100% FREE) unless you feel like keeping it. Other than that, this app is easy to use and has helped me make some TikTok videos, you can use this on anything other than TikTok if you’d like as I may use this for YouTube editing also. (Haven’t yet but I bet the edits will also come out good just like my TikTok edits.)

10/10 Recommended to friends&family!!!"

This app is a really good app and really easy to use! The effects are beautiful 100/10! You can make it slower and higher! I love it so so much! Way better then kind master it takes forever to load! Thank you for making this amazing app!! It’s so helpful!!
It’s a good app I mean it could use work. First it always says my storage is full so I delete some apps it still says it’s full so I deleted my photos FULL.😐this really annoyed me! So I reset me iPhone And it doesn’t work. I wasted me time.it’s also not as good as other apps like video star king master It’s nice that you can delete the watermark tho. Overall it’s alright but not necessarily good.
"CapCut is a very nice app! It’s easy, free, and fun! I recommend this app for ppl who want to make edits, or like me a YouTube channel! They also don’t have a watermark! I love CapCut!"
"I am using an iPhone 8, and the templates tab isn’t showing up. I’ve been trying to get it using YouTube tutorials for a week now and it still hasn’t come up. Other that that, perfect app!"
So I was just looking for a editing app andI found this it has YouTube stuff and effects And even more more. I give it 5 out of 5 star’s
I honestly feel like if CapCut had graphs that edits could be a lot smoother. It wouldn’t be stiff and laggy.also add tiles and shakes
It’s a really good editing app but I’m trying to redownload the app and its not working so now I can’t edit. But the app is really good I love all of the animations.But can you guys make it so that we can add more overlays it will make it more easy to do animation  I will really like this editing app way more than I do right now.Ahywasy this app is really really really really really really really really really really really really really really good so keep making this editing app really good bye!
Okay so i have been using this app for a while and the graphs update just came out not so long ago. (I have an iphone) and every time i click on the graphs button it says “Use graphs to customize translations key frames.” From there it doesn’t let me use the graphs and it just says that. I don’t know if this is because i’m not doing something right or that if i need to do something before doing the graphs. This might just be my capcut being weird. I’ve watched some youtube videos and i have seen anyone go though what im going though so im just confused on what im meant to do. Besides that this app is pretty good for an editing app. 4/5
Ok so I was watching YouTube  and they were using CapCut and I was like I want to do that and that’s when I found it  it’s so cool!!!
"I know plenty of video editors that don't put their logo at the end of my video, sponsor my TikTok @aftermath.420 and I’ll advertise, other than that I’m going with splice"
I just want to say CapCut is the best or at least one of the best FREE editing apps out there I have no idea how to do editing but I saw my friends using this so I decided to give it a try it is so easy for beginners and I love how easy it is to make videos for TikTok and YouTube overall I love CapCut I may just be stupid but I’d really like if there was a way to you take sound out of the video completelyEspecially for videos where you’re moving the camera around a lot and it makes weird noises or picks up noise from your breathing that mayBe a feature and I just don’t know it but either way CapCutIs amazingAnd I will continue to use it for a long time
PLZZ add somewhere where we can look at other people’s work and we are aloud to make a channel there! We can be cloggers on that app! Also add uhm get to edit the background and channel part! My fam will love if that could happen! (Just some advice so you can have more people using it and YouTube! You can earn money with this! Think of it!)-hey I’m just helping 🤩
I love this I use it all the time to edit YouTube vids but it needs to be less complicated
Capcut is a great editing app it just needs better fonts Android has a lot of fonts iOS does not have if capcut were to give some good fonts to iOS capcut would be a spectacular editing app if they just gave iOS better fonts and upgrade some effects. And they should also make it so you can have as many overlay tracks as possible. And capcut should also add some new animations and transitions. And that’s all I think capcut needs to do in Oder to be spectacular
I love this app so much! I edit all of my YouTube videos with it!💖💖💖💖 I have only had one little bug but it has only happened twice!!! This app is amazing! Hands down best app for editing! Everything is absolutely free!!!! My dad bought this 300$ editing app and I told him to try CapCut (which is totally free!) and he tried it and now he loves it so much he says ikr is way better than his 300$ app!!!! I am so happy I found out about this app! My dad rates it a 10/10 and same with me!💯 please get it if you are looking for and editing app!!! At least try it out!
So first the title is the reason I am making this I had to DELETE CapCut because of the mb! It’s too high pleas PLEASE lower the mb!
"Hi, this app is great, it’s amazing for Gacha video editing which I, personally do A WHOLE LOT. Where I found this app was, a while back my sister made aesthetic videos with the app CapCut. I used to use iMovie on laptop but got too hard. I’m very greatful to be able to have this app. My sister recommended me it because I was a Gacha video editing and a lot of ppl use this.But can you add more text options? There is only like a few, while other editing softwares have many to choose, While CapCut only has a few. Plus, have not updated them AT ALL. I am hoping this will come in future updates. Also, one quick question. Do you have any socials? Where people can share ideas for future updates? I would love that. But I love the fact there are soooo many aesthetic audios, and pop, rock, jazz, soft, Japanese and you name it! Sadly I have to give… FIVE STARS! Thank you for all the amazing features."
"I have been using CapCut for a year and it never lets me down, their is so many features such as filters, fonts, and editing tools. Before every app was hard to edit videos until I found CapCut. They make it so simple and easy and deserve 100/10 review."
"i think this app is super handy, but where’s version 4.6.0? everyone’s been talking about it, but i can’t find it on android OR iOS. what is the deal-
EDIT: nvm, 4.6.0 is here now :]"
"I have an edits YouTube channel, and by far, this is the best editing app I have found!"
"First of all, I upload all of my YouTube videos with this, it’s free to use, and it’s overall amazing.
 The question I have is how do you make thumbnails for YouTube? I know how to edit them, but I don’t know how to apply them to the video. Thanks!"
"I’m a beginner at gachatube and editing, and I think this app is amazing for beginners! There is only one problem… I keep seeing something about a graphs update on Youtube, but I can’t find it on my app and I haven’t got the option to update Capcut."
I was really liking this app and started using it for all my edits but now I noticed it updated and everything looks weird I can’t make edits the same way I used to so I’m disappointed. I also noticed some transitions are gone and the transitions aren’t in the place they use to be everything is flipped around it’s making it hard to do anything on this app. Please fix this cause I need to make an edit for my YouTube channel
"I found this app about 1month ago and it’s realllllly the best MOVIE EDITOR EVER!! without any doubt!
Everything is great on IOS, BUT , I have problem opening .MOV videos on ANDROID!

I just send my .MOV files from IPHONE to SAMSUNG TABLET for having bigger LCD size there, but unfortunately CAPCUT ANDROID VERSION don’t open these files!!

Anybody knows any solution for it??

Best regards."
Don’t get me wrong. I love this app. But what if I had to delete this or get a new phone? Will all of my work be safe or will it be gone?
"CapCut is my go to editor!I don’t know why it’s 12+, but I say its 5+.This is a great editor of you are looking for a mobile roblox edit app.Once you learn how to use it, your videos will be phenomenal.This app has features like effects, audio editing, splits, noise effects, a way to do shading, and more!If you are looking for an editor, this is your best choice for mobile 

     Thank you,
             -Demi Fisher"
"I’ve seen that most android users have gotten it, from an apk. On your official tiktok account, you seem to have had it on iOS. I only see the “font freedom” update, so where are the graphs?"
This app helped my edits get 40k followers on tiktok and 18k on YouTube. This is legit so good for a free app.
Add better background remover
I SWEAR PLEASE ADD A SMOOTH SLOMO AND LIFE WILL BE FOOD PLEASE
Everyone is getting the new graph update but I AM NOT.Is it a glich or something like where is my update man
CapCut helped me do my thumbnails for my YouTube videos and helped me do some advanced editing this is a awesome app! You have to download now! This was about the best app I ever had thank you CapCut
I have made 10 edits with this and it was so fun and easy. I posted them to YouTube my name is Copy_Ninja_12. I only posted 4-5 tho. Over all I really do recommend the app.
u ruided my vid bc u wont let me change the vol very bad 1/9999999
Ok this is the best!!! I really recommend it than other editing apps.like VITA because it has more stuff and really isn’t hard to do.This is the best one so far I have came across! It is really good for your videos if you are a youtuber.
I saw a tiktok about graphs and I went to check the new update and I found out it’s only for android 😐😐😐 Android is allowed to have it but not iPhone
Down j few uh wid buc d. Nicer. N hucdnI HATE IT UHG
CapCut is wonderful but the thing is capcut is not good enough they need to add atleast a phew things every week maybe or something because my fans need some more action but CapCut is plain I want more motion in CapCut over all it’s great and I think it should be for 10+ because my cuz wants to do it and I think 10 year olds can do it and it’s ok if not I was just wondering and CapCut thanks so much I would not have grew so much on YouTube without you ty peace out
Ok so CapCut is a great app I’ve been CapCut for years but today I tried making an edit for YouTube and all m edits were gone I tried to close the app and reopen it but it didn’t work. Pls fix this right away.
"CapCut is great for beginners. But, i have a problem. The reason why i give it a half star because of storage. When i got the app I loved it then it told me I needed an album? I was so confused. I search it up on YouTube and it showed nothing..? I started to freak out because I only like that editing app. I had like 300 photos and videos all together! now I’m not going on it because of the storage an album problem. thanks for reading!"

"This app is awesome and I Definite recommend getting this app you can do just about anything and it’s free as a bee! I’ve made countless videos on this app snd I love it so much it lets you add how long hints show up for text, music, animation for things like text, it has text to speech, voice overs and much more! I love there music but I wish I could import my own..well you can do that but you have to have iTunes, witch I don’t have. I have Spotify and you can’t import it from there that’s the one thing that I would like this app to add. But otherwise really this this is too good to be true…but guess what it is true everything you could think of for and editing app is all in this one for free! Now go on, download it!"
"Hi great Leaders, 🌺🌺🌺🌺
I am requesting you plz to add persian language to the application. It's great and amazing app. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Plz do a favor and consider my request for adding persian language (on behalf of other persia people). plz 🙏🙏🙏 

Thx a 1000000 💐💐💐💐"
I just got this app about a month ago but I am obsessed that I can’t stop making edits it is the best thing if you were trying to create a YouTube channel or TickTock channel for a Roblox edits! I think this app is amazing and you should definitely try it it is the best thing that has come! However I am still learning how to use it and I do have questions I enjoy this very much!
10/10 greet app
"I have a ton of problems importing videos. And with the latest update, it won’t let me save videos without telling me to go into my settings and allow access to my photos (which isn’t even an option, and I could save before)

I personally don’t use capcut for editing often, but please add graphs. It would be amazing. Also more transitions would be nice.

I wish capcut would sustain longer video imports and file sizes.  I use capcut for editing my YouTube videos, but it’s hard when it starts lagging when I try to edit a video longer than 5 minutes. 

But, these are just my complaints. Capcut is an amazing editing app, it has a ton of options for transitions, filters & effects with no charge."
I absolutely love this app!! It’s been working fine but all a sudden all me edits disappeared and my video that I was working on for my YouTube channel was gone and I couldn’t fix it!! I hope you can fix this I really want my content back
"Hello! So, I usually use CapCut for my YouTube videos. But most of the time CapCut just doesn’t work and says I have to clear up some photos and apps. This makes me really annoyed because I’ve dealt with this problem for 2 weeks now. Maybe you could fix it? Idk but I just hope it works right again."
"I like it a lot, but it needs new things like selective zoom, subtitles in Spanish, ability to import fonts, cloud saving (not on iCloud) and things like that. 

This has nothing to do but, I want to spread the Gospel, so If you follow God, or want to, might like my page, this is not for my benefit, it’s for you and God’s Kingdom. God bless you a lot.

"CAPCUT,, BABES.. U KEEP ADDING SO MUCH STUFF BUT GRAPHS PLS ADD GRAPHSSSXENXHRNX"
"I have used free apps for a while to edit youtube videos but all the free app editors had watermarks and didn’t have good filters and all the extra animation that capcut has. This is the best free editor app i’ve come across in all my years in video editing. It is even better than some payed editors. I highly recommend and promise you wont be disappointed in getting this app. However a very annoying thing ive noticed is that when I have a few lines of text in my edit and have animations on all of them, only some of the animations will save and the rest will stop doing the animations. Please fix this, it will my editing a lot easier. Thanks."
I think it’s a great app and it really helps me make videos for my YouTube channel
I have a editing apps and there hard to edit. This is the best editing app ever so tysm whoever made this app. I can now make better YouTube videos cause of this app. I love this app so much. This is so fun to use I had no videos to edit and I wanted to edit still. Tysm whoever made this app bc this app is the best editing app ever!
"hi,
I have been using this app for almost a year now and I would say this app is really nice! it could use some improvements.but otherwise it’s  really nice! I just wish some things like the diamond 
tool, was a little more smooth,but that’s my opinion.
I suggest getting this app and practice."
I love the app it is free which makes it easy to create YouTube videos and edits.
BEST APP DOWNLOAD NOW I USE IT FOR YOUTUBE ITS AMAZING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love this app I ate all my videos I put on YouTube and I love it teachers in my opinion is it free and since I personally do not want to spend any money on an app game I really like cat cat since it’s free but I just have some things I can’t do what you can do another abs it cost money you be fine but that’s just me in my own opinion but I really like it and I recommend downloading it if you are adding or if you’re starting off your YouTube channel or for example Tik Tok account or maybe you’re adding some thing to post on Instagram such as a Instagram video or some thing I recommend loading this up and if you’re making the cameras for videos directly down downloading picsart as well
I love the app and all but when I press on the text to spearhead button it always says no Internet connection and my internet is perfectly fine please fix the glitch cuz I may make this review a 1 pls fix it @capcut
"I like it but I hate it when it says “no photos here, make some now!” WHEN CLEARLY I HAVE TONS OF PHOTOS! This happens every time I touch the music part, but still useful for my YouTube videos!"
"Hey! When i first ever got CapCut it was a really easy app even for me and my little cousin (10) i was a Gacha kid and wanted to make Gacha life Tiktoks so someone commented on my videos saying that i should use capcut it easier and quicker so i did. Soon after, i became a dream smp fan, i edited velocities, photo montages, videos of my drawings, and etc. then it comes to now 09/16/21 i have no clue what i am I’m just making ghost face edits and edits of random people. It’s really easy to use as i said in the beginning, but fr i mean it I’ll be using this app until it dies. bUuuut the real reason why i only gave it 4 stars is because, it’s been glitching recently so I’m having a hard time rn."

"Capcut is a very easy editing app and helped me learn lots. It is also free which is great but there are a few suggestions I have. 

One thing that I totally recommend is for the text to be updated. By this I mean that it would be good if we could edit word by word when we type a phrase. This would also save a lot of time.

Also I noticed that on android devices that you can now add your own fonts from websites like “dafont.com” and was wondering if that update will be coming to IOS. Also a few new fonts would be great! I totally recommend the font “Lemon Milk”.

Another thing I think would be good is if you guys made a velocity feature to slow down clips or made your speed feature a bit smoother. 

This would all really help make my edits a whole lot better."
"So good, bottom of my heart people could make movies from this. Total savior been using since Jan 9 2021 and it’s completely changed everything."
"I have used this app to make tiktok edits and to edit youtube videos! And I love it!! I have used it for a pretty long time now and to be honest i think i like it more than iMovie. IMovie is great but this app is also great! I will say iMovie have some features that capcut doesn’t but it’s still great! Scrolling through the videos is really fast unlike iMovie. When you scroll through the video on imovie it is kinda slow especially for a long video. But capcut can scroll through the videos fast! Also you can cut the videos easier in capcut than iMovie. Other good things about capcut is that they feature more animations, text templates, and music! Although i used iMovie for many years, i think i like capcut even more. :)"
It's great needs some work for example maybe a tutorial since newbies are very likley to get lost. and if going on youtube they are comparing this app to others which could cause this app to loose people and eventually dissapearing. but make it skipable.
"First of all this is an amazing app I do gacha life with it . I do have a suggestion for this app there should be an eraser that you can erase some of the photo and fill it in with something else. Anyways I prefer this app then any other one.second suggestion is that can we just search up music? It would be so helpful because I don’t like the other apps.also  One thing I hate is that when you add the photos the slides take a long time I know how to cut them out but can you please make them a bit shorter I would be more then grateful. One thing I love is it is so easier then any other editing app ,I use to use FMP but it got too hard so I looked for some other I was looking and looking till I found cap cut so easy to use. Anyways thank you so much for reading this bye!"
"I love this app I have so many videos with this app. Its so cool you can do so many things, Putting music is easy too you need to make a video and click to sounds in there are three options click exterior but first go to YouTube and do a screen video from the song you want then go to CapCut and do your video click sounds click exterior and click in the screen video you made and done music and everything ☺️☺️"
"Capcut is an awesome app, i use it to edit music videos for my zepeto group nextlevel.zpt !!! but i have a few requests, it would be HEAVENLY if an option to skew photos & overlays were possible, because i have to switch to another app to do that. it would also be awesome to add color to the video/overlay, to make it blend better with the background. Also, being able to manually erase part of the video/overlay instead of only cropping!!!! those are some of my wishes, i really want to continue to use capcut!! <3"

"Overall this app is great, I use it to edit my YouTube videos and it works perfect. I love all of the properties to choose from, (Text properties, effects, etc.) I would 100% Recommend this app and was recommended it myself. it’s amazingly free as well! Thank you for making a great free video editor!"
Well I want a cover just for fun and then when i put it to YouTube it shows the cover in the video while watching but everything else pretty nice
"I have been using CapCut for a while and it is a great app. It’s free, no ads, no watermark, and tons of effects and filters to use! I use it to edit YouTube videos and make edits and I have only came across one problem. Sometimes when I am not touching the screen for a short period of time, the main screen (edit, audio, text, stickers, overlay, effects, filters, format, canvas, adjust) that screen will turn grey and there will be no icons or anything they all disappear and I can’t click anything there. Everything else works during that time but I cannot add anything so I have to close the project and re-open it. I even updated the app but it still happens. Re-opening the project is not a big deal but when I’m trying to edit 30 minute long videos fir my YouTube, it gets annoying. Please fix if you can or tell me how to fix this. Other then that, this app is great!"
hello this is my review on “capcut” app i think its very difficult
"I love this app, it’s how I make my YouTube channel videos! The key frames make me able to do some what of custom transitions!"
"Usually I installed it, and needed help for my YouTube video. And not all the other apps work for me! So I found this app and I was able to turn it into a dream of making every single thing right. And usually we can change it into any type of language of the basic type of Korean, Japanese, Asian, Tagalog, or any type of language that some of you speak.. I used this app for 10 months and The whole entire app was pretty cool and having some pretty cool updates on it! And my brother has been using it for 50 months more than I did, Cuz’ If you guys download this pretty cool app! You will actually love this developer what he or she just made Cuz’ it’s more better more than PicsArt cuz’ it showed up not from CapCut only at the end also my friend have been using CapCut for 70 weeks So yeah that is why we vote for CapCut more than PicsArt! Also If the Developer it’s looking at my comment! Thank you for making the whole intire set of steps for me! Or for anyone else.."
Sometimes my pictures don’t show up and when they do I would not let me send it to TikTok or YouTube
This editing app make me learn how to edit got good editing skills on YouTube and tiktok my yt is Gernade Gunner
"So, I’m in love with capcut. It’s literally the only app I use to edit videos on tiktok. Follow my tiktok @kennedieee0 . I rlly wanna use video star but it’s so confusing and I rlly don’t wanna waste my money on somethin I don’t know how to do. So I just use capcut bc it’s easy and doesn’t make me confused ! :) and if you need tutorials for capcut they are so easy to watch and you can understand them better! Yes I’m not trying to bring video star down! But I recommend capcut :)"
"I loved the app at first and it was perfect until you try to export your finished project, bunch of mf waste of time. Even went to their YouTube page for help and it still failed. I’d avoid this app and wasting your precious time"
this app is just-what I NEEDED after THESE months of my yt channel! This IS JUST- the BEST editing App IVE EVER HAD! It’s so amazing like- u can almost do EVERYTHING u need in the APP! I just don’t know how to describe it it’s Just so HELPFUL AND ALL! I’d rate this a 10000000/10!
"Ok so I am making a YouTube video with the app, and it keeps kicking me out whenever I go fast through the clips! It is a great app, but I don’t want to be kicked out every time. It gets annoying"
"Capcut is a very nice app AnD it’s for free?!? I do YouTube videos and tiktok edits it’s a very good and easy app to edit on just I wish the effects and animations would have more maybe take some notes from video star! And alimotion sorry if I spelled one wronge. 

Video star and alitmotion are very good apps but are too hard for me to find out to use and I need to buy some things from the app so if you stay free capcut TRUST me you will soon be a five star app if you find out how to add the animation and effects from both of theses apps also add more animations!!!"
"The app is amazing 🤩, but sometimes when it say clear some storage and I do it never works.But now my Roblox vids look more cooler than my other ones. U should really get this app because it’s easy to use and to me it’s kinda exiting when u finish the vids. I hope y’all like the app 2.😄"
"So I had this app over 2 or 3 months..it’s amazing!!
So I was editing a video for 5 hours..and then my phone died,I charged it back up and went back on the app,I tapped the video I was working on,and it said “insufficient storage” I understand that I need to delete all the photos and videos off my phone,but funimate,kinemaster,and editing apps like this doesnt have that.Sorry to complain.It’s a great app that I use everyday.🙂

Keep up the great work ❤️"
It’s amazing I really really really love it I know some people hate it but it’s just so amazing!
"I use this app SOOO MUCH! It’s an awesome app to make commercials, movies, and more! I even make gaming videos on there! You can even see some of the cool effects and techniques I use on my yt channel ObviouslyKarlie. 
This app is awesome 1000/ 5 stars for me! It’s amazing! I recommend it for everyone! 💖💖"
Perfect for youtube videos. Also you guys need a photo editor. I can imagine it would be great!
Really good Really good Really good Really good Really good Really good Really good Really good Really good Really good Really good Really good Really good Really good Really good Really good Really good Really good Really good Really good Really good Really good Really good Really good Really good
"Omg I use this app for my YouTube channel and I LOVE IT! You can… filter, put videos together, edit pictures and make a short cut, you can add music and it gives you choices of moving pictures on your shortcut. On Project you can put as many videos as you want and it will put them together, you also can add music! I think you guys will love this app!"
This is a good editor thingy
"This app is great and all I have been using it for tiktoks but as I wanted to use it i only had ONE.ONE SHORT VIDEO I WANTED TO EDIT, but it said”oh your storage is too full 🥺”I cleaned out EVERYTHING.EVERYTHING. EXEPT FOR THAT SHORT VIDEO. and it STILL SAID “your storage is too full 🥺🌸” PLEASE FIX THIS. ITS ANNOYING"
So I downloaded this app and I fricken love it! It helps my YouTube channel a lot! And the best part of this is that cap cut is the best lol! But no fro real this is the best app had been ever made and I’m not lieing!
Die you poop app I hope you delete this app
This app is awesome to edit!! I recommended it helps you make what you need !!! I’m learning how to use it! It’s a struggle to learn but I’m getting better and better!! Will it would be Awsome if Cap cut Creators could add more 3D make up 💅💋💄Will that’s all!! I rate the app 10000+/5 starts ⭐️🌟✨💫😊😊
"Hey, I’m unable to download filters and effects as it’s showing no internet connection but I have a strong WiFi connection. I have deleted application and download multiple time used different network to download but failed to download it.help me with the same. Expecting good result ."
"So,I make fear street edits with capcut and I’m in love. good quality  and everything. You can make the same edits on Capcut for free than using vs or vsp for like 14.99 

Like this review plz"
This app is the best editing app ever I use it to edit my YouTube videos and my Instagram my edits just just random things it is so helpful although I do have a suggestion so that you can search your songs so you won’t have to just keep on scrolling
"The fact that all the features are free, it’s easy to use and most importantly, THE QUALITY IS AMAZING. Props to the developers, please never change. Thank you <3"
So basically I like to do gacha club and Roblox edits I usually do them on kinemaster but on YouTube I kept seeing things for CapCut I decided to download it but I kept deleting photos and apps it still will not let me make a project it’d super annoying and it needs to be fixed
"I have been using CapCut for around 2 months now and it’s CRAZY you can remove green screens, add music, ADD WORDS TO VIDEOS!! ITS JUST CRAZY I love this editing app so much I edit all my videos on YouTube with CapCut and it’s AMAZING for intros!
I JUST DONT GET IT!!! I love CapCut 5/5 DEFINITELY"
"I love CapCut! It’s really helpful for my edits. I do Roblox edits and sometimes I use CapCut to edit my YouTube videos. But one thing that kinda gets in my nerves is, everyone j want to add a photo it says I don’t have any. So I go back and check my camera roll and I have photos. So i don’t know if it’s just a glitch… but that’s really it! I totally recommend this app to edit your videos."
"This app does give me some stress while editing my YouTube videos also my channel name is “《•「XxKaulaxX」•》” it stresses me because when I want to edit again, it does something wrong to it and I think I wanted to be fixed. Also, when I do text to speech and play it while I’m editing, I can’t hear the voice that well it just glitches. Those need to be fixed. Anyways it’s still very cool! I like it! Good editing app but still has bugs.."
✨😄😮😮😊👍👍😮😮😄👍👍😮✨👍😊😄👍😊😄😄
This app is a perfect for Editinf no watermarks no Paying no nothing but It takes a HELLA amount of space not 112 MB IM TALKING GB IT SHOULDENT TAKE THAT MUCH SPACE!
this app helped me with YouTube videos with editing and Tiktoks/Instagram THIS APP GOT MY VIDEO 13k likes and 7K followers YOU GUYS NEED TO GET THIS APP NOW
"As you can see, as a YouTube you need to upload so I use this, 
Though every once in a while it says that I have no storage left, so I have to delete an app that I love to make more content unless I re- get the app, which is what I’m doing, this doesn’t make sence"
Poop
"I wanted to get this app for the templates that other people have made in the past but when I opened it, it literally did not have the option for templates, nor the other options in the bottom that normally showed up in YouTube reviews. Am I tripping or what??"
"I love this app Beause you get to do so kuch thing on it and you can do cool thing too you can make intros edits videos for your YouTube channel  and you can post your videos on tiktok any platform I love cap cut you should download it will change your channel

YouTube channel queen sis plays gaming and queen sis plays"
10/10 should use I use it for all my YouTube vids and I get hundreds of likes so if ur an upcoming YouTube get CapCut! Trust me it works miracles!
"This app is amazing and useful especially when I want to make YouTube videos! And I especially love that there is no watermark or premium!! That makes everything better and makes it easier to make my videos look professional! I do have one small problem though:when I import sound and then go to photos, It says: No photos here! Take some pictures to add to your video! Or something like that. This is very frustrating when I want to make videos. But other than that this is an amazing app and I think everyone should have this app if they enjoy making videos but hate the popups that say: Get premium now! Or Go premium! And people who don’t like the watermark at the top!!"
I love the app! And I use it a lot for editing my YouTube videos! But there is one thing I really hate:( it takes up so much storage on my IPad and I can’t really have any other apps on this IPad because it takes up so much storage! It takes up 2.87 GB on my IPad so if there is anything you can do please fix the amount of storage it takes up...
WaAah wanna break from the adds
It’s amazing I use it for my videos on YouTube and it works amazing
I love cap cut it helps me a lot I just made a YouTube video and it works awesome for thanks cap cup is the best
hey i just want to say please remove the watermark that’s like at the end great app tho i just needed to learn how to use it from youtube so great app!
I’m starting a YouTube channel and every time I do a voiceover it sounds like a beeping sound please fix it now!!!!!😤😤 it upsets me so much every time I try to do a voiceover it’s a big beeping sound
"I feel like this app is really cool and it makes it really easy to edit videos, especially gaming. All the cool effects makes everything look good, the audio control is amazing, etc. But one thing I wish they would change is how when you download the video from CapCut to your camera roll and the screen pops up that tells you where you can share it, (Like Instagram) I feel like it would be good to put YouTube there as well. Other apps have done this too and I hope the developer will add this feature!"
More animations
"This app is great for my edits that I love to make but one thing that is super annoying about this app is that if I save a YouTube video into my camera role to edit, it doesn’t save In CapCut, it shows the video that I took before it, but when I click recents at the top, it shows that it has the video but just won’t let me put it into my video, it really annoys me and I hope you can change this and if not I’m probably gonna move to a different editors app because I’ve tried everything and this app this doesn’t work. Another problem I had with this app is that it said that I couldn’t use the filters because I didn’t have wifi but I was full bars, and my phone isn’t old so it wouldn’t be something that’s a glitch in my phone. Please fix so I don’t have to change my source 😁✌🏽☺️"
"I 100% recommended this app, personally this is my favorite video editor! It’s free, easy to use, cool to make edits and edit regular YouTube videos! However I have 2 suggestions. I think it’s really cool that it has a camera roll sticker feature, however you can only do pictures. I think it will be really cool if you can also make it so you can do videos, my last video editor had that feature but it was like $10, something I was not willing to pay. I would like it so I can do reactions, and more. I also wish you can search music. Other than that, this is an amazing editor and I definitely recommend."
I tried CapCut and I liked it I made lots of roblox and tik tok edits.I also made Gathca Club edits.But whenever I try to edit my video it won’t let me because I need to update it but I can’t update it!!!!!!! PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!!
Eqriokqsmxpoqjdnfcoijoiegwjnwoeivrnwrveoijnoihwebrbvoijwernaepojrnvwpiejrjnvvqpijernfqokjejrfnoiqeiojroivjnwoeirjnvwpojrfnvqoijernvoijwernv good. Storksn strok stoker stroke. Heh
"I love capcut I love the shakes transition and other stuff . So my first suggestion is we should have a thing we’re you can make an velocity edit I know video star already have this but you have to pay but if y’all make velocity thing then we can get it for free .  And I know we got something like a thing that makes your video go fast and slow but I feel like the thing like video star would be better.next more fonts I don’t really have nothing to say about fonts but yea we just need more fonts. Next more animations like a hard zigzag shake or something Yall can think of . Next y’all should make something like when we can add more than one animation than making another project and add the animation then go back to the original project an add the 2nd project and then add another animation. Next you guys should add more stock videos like green screens of cards,Pokémon ball,laptops,and more you guys can think of. Next more filters . And that’s all hope you like my suggestions"
It’s a very good app and I love that everything is free but one small thing I noticed is that maybe by the export part you could add an export to YouTube so it much easier than having to open the app ever time I wanna publish a video but overall an AMAZING app and definitely recommend.
"So I love this app I use it for everything but there’s things I wish there were in the app. So one thing is more animations, I love the animations but I’m sure I used every one and I think it could use more animations. Next is quality. When I export it with high and smooth frames and when I upload it to YouTube the quality looks rly bad. Idk if it’s YouTube or the app. Next is more effects. Now ik that there r a lot of effects but I think the app could add a effect like a black explode with the picture fading out like it comes out from the picture. That wold be cool with a edit in my opinion. I hope this isn’t to much but I do love the app it’s rly great⭐️"
"Hi! I love this app it’s my main editor for my YouTube channel! I want to grow my channel and let’s just say.. it has once I switched from iMovie to KineMaster To THIS! 5 Stars! Here’s a suggestion:
New Effects! Bulge and pinch! 
Where you can move the effects around anywhere, I mean like the wand section effects thing that would be amazing 🤩 love your app 5 stars! 
Thanks for reading!
Ps: if anyone’s curious about my yt it’s called Ech Noirs"
"This app helps me with my YouTube channel and has its own unique features that inspires me ✨ one thing is sometimes the bar on the bottom glitches or deletes clips I added that I worked hard on, other then that it’s still a great app for beginners on YouTube or inspired developers."

I’m glad this have the Cut tool where you choose the part you wanna remove.Thank you for including this tool and making this app free!
"I think this app is very good for mostly simple edits and for beginners like myself! I think with just a little help from YouTube videos and the internet, you can make some pretty cool edits that you can save on your device! :)"
"So my problem is you can't use half of the stuff that's in the app since it says you have no internet connection when you do, I searched it on YouTube and it said you had to live in South Korea or get a vpn to make it look like you are in South Korea, pls fix this half of your features are going to waste"
ITS NOICE MY RBLX @ana2010ira ADD ME
It’s really great download it if your a YouTube or TikTok Instagram any social media or for family and friends it’s easy too
Im not going to lie its the best app if you’re a beginner okay but i would love if they’re more effects and more like video star kit so difficult though.The best app though
i love this 10/10 its just i wish you could add a thing where you can add transitions to your favourites because it kinda gets annoying when you have to scroll and scroll to find it when you could just click a button and all your favourite or recently used transitions are there! other than that i give the app a 10/10 and if there are any people reading this then go ahead and download it theres no ads and it really easy to use and you can find a bunch of tutorial on YouTube and TikTok!
It Says you’re storage is full! YOU NEED TO DELETE YOUR WORK.DON’T GET THIS APP! I would give this a 0/5. It’s just useless. I have 1 video and it says YOU’RE STORAGE IS FULL! WHAT THE HECK IS WRONG WITH THIS APP! Don’t get it’s very bad🙄✋ try it out. It’s your opinion.I’m trying not to be so dramatic but this app needs to get fixed.I’m sorry but I had to say this bc this app is making me mad
I saw some write about this but this really needs to stop with the “no storage” my friend is trying to get a YouTube but I can’t edit her videos cause this stupid app won’t let me get the video and edit really needs an update I really hate the “no storage”😐

"i don’t know what i was expecting, but certainly not what this app has to offer. i have been filming youtube videos for over 5 years now, & until finding this app, i had yet to find an editing app with trendy, aesthetic - all around everything i needed in an editing app. imovie & videofxlive is nothing compared to this app. not only is this app extremely beginner friendly, it also has a VARIETY of effects, fonts, filters, animations, copy-write free music, & almost anything you can imagine in an editing app. the music is trendy & far from cliche. the fonts are VERY TRENDY & come in many many different expressions & styles. the filters are categorized by nature, food, vhs, lifestyle, soooo many choices! not to mention: EVERYTHING ON THE APP IS FREE! as well as 0 watermarks! thank you for creating such AN AMAZING, HANDY, CREATIVE iphone editor! the only con that i have heard from this app is that it doesn’t support videos over 15 minutes, & that’s not a problem, videos over 15 minutes are very rare to make on an iphone anyways due to storage limitations. overall i SO PLEASED with this app. 5/5 stars for me."
For the good part it’s great you can do lots of animating and the sickest are great the app is amazing when I came across this app 2 Months ago this app was perfect but today I got a new iPad and also and android because some thing worn working right. The only problem I keep having is when I set my photos to 1 second or lower it will glitch to the next photo without showing it on the view screen. Second it will tell me to update the app so I would do it but it would already be updated. That’s all I need those fixed please thanks for your time 👍
Whenever I use an overlay and I replay the edit to see if it was used correctly and it lags only when I use transitions and overlays would you please fix this? Its annoying when it lags out of nowhere skipping some of the next clip/image.Thank you.
"I really love this app, I’ve been using this for months now. I’d just like to give a few comments and suggestions. So, trying to make a velocity edit on here is pretty hard and it usually doesn’t fit to peoples standers. I’m trying to make a transparent watermark but all I can do is lower the capacity or try doing this hack I found on YouTube which failed by the way😂. I hope that we can get more animations for the text (loop). I find it stressful that I can’t split the effects in anyway, and it’s be cool if the effects had an option to fade in and fade out. Also I also find it stressful and time consuming when on a clip I can’t put both fade in and fade out so what I have to do is split the clip and on one part of the clip I put fade in and the other fade out. I also hate that the app demands that I free up space and because of that I had to delete all my games because the app is way to good😣. It’d also be great if we were able to make 8d audio on this app. You should also add more effects for the audio. That’s all that I could think of for now👋"
This app is AWESOME and inspired me to make a YouTube channel
"I enjoyed CapCut in the beginning. It was easy to learn and get used to. Yesterday I was editing a video to upload to my YouTube. When I was done I clicked saved and it said  “not enough memory”. I deleted some photos in my camera roll, some drafts in CapCut, and cleared my cache in CapCut settings. Once I tried again it still said “not enough memory”. I was really disappointed because I spent over 45 minutes editing that. I looked up on YouTube “what to do when CapCut won’t save your videos” and there were no tutorials, it was just people complaining about the same problem. I looked in the comments and people were also saying they had the same problem. This wasn’t happening until now. I’ve had CapCut for a while now and it hasn’t done this before. At the moment I am not pleased and very disappointed. I hope CapCut can fix this soon."
CapCut is one of the best apps you can use for editing.It helps with a lot of things you can do with anything but in a shortcut way things you can do by editing it’s just so easy on the app and sorry guys I’m not really used to reviewing but this app is so amazing and you guys need to get it I love it so much is good for videos and pictures is this get in there in the bag that’s free it makes it even better I love you it helps with a lot of things you can do with anything but in a shortcut way things you can do by editing it’s just so easy on the app and sorry guys I’m not really used to reviewing but this app is so amazing and you guys need to get it I love it so much is good for videos and pictures the fact  that’s free it makes it even better I love you CapCut .
I love this game it is the best it has so many things so you can edit.it’s amazing! I edited so many things and they now look fab! I live the app it might need some practice to get really good but it’s awesome!
So basically I’ve been using this ever since I started making a YouTube channel but I hate that I have to delete videos I love and proud of it always says I have full storage even tho I have like three videos
I saw this game on YouTube and I pressed download but it won’t let me download it
Sometimes CapCut on my tablet it says there’s like no storage left and I can’t save the video that I did but yet I have nothing that’s like taking up a lot of storage and I really hate that so I think you guys should update it because it’s really getting me annoyed How I have to l screen record the video that I’m doing so can you guys change that because I’m gonna start a YouTube channel but if that’s keeps on popping up I’m not gonna be able to post any of my videos but overall this app is really good
"I went through 3 absolutely terrible editing apps before this and they all made me pay! This app is completely free and has great transitions/animations. I definitely recommend if you enjoy making videos! I have a YouTube channel (it’s called, I ✨Simp✨ For Saya) And post regularly on there, this app helps a lot! Have a great day/night!💕"
"I love this app it’s free and no watermark, but when I try to post a YouTube video and I’ll do the cover a K a thumbnail it doesn’t show up so that stinks, other than that it’s an OK app I recommend it for you editors but honestly I like it a lot better than kindmaster but still I don’t know why the cover a.k.a. thumbnail it’s not working so other than that it’s an OK app"
So this app is great it’s very easy for beginner editors and I’ve been using it for a while but there are a few suggestions I think  should be made. First I cannot change my frames sometimes when I post my edit it’s always a cube shape and I cannot fix it there is no option for me to have another picture frame rate. Next is the quality so I made a edit and it was a HD quality video and I selected  the frame rate 50 and the quality 2k and when I exported it and posted it on YouTube it came out as 480p I do not know if it’s because of YouTube or CapCut. Another. Suggestion is more smooth transitions there are a lot of smooth ones but I feel you egoism maybe make a setting to change it to like pro editors for us to make some more smoother edits. I also suggest more stock videos for like intros! That’s all I love this app and definitely recommend
"If I could give out an award to the best editing app, this one would definitely be my first choice. This app is amazing! From the fonts of the words to the unique animations, CapCut easily is the greatest editing app you could possibly download. But here’s the thing that will be the best for y’all in college struggling to pay your tuition and all you can do to make money is create YouTube videos: The app is free! Honestly, I was surprised and amazed on how incredible this app was when I first got it. I’m not trying to shame other editing apps, but CapCut easily takes the win for best editing app. Five stars to you! Bravo!"
so people in youtube kept saying that capcut was bad so i wanted to try it out and i do not regret it. whenever i make new edits with capcut i watch them more that at least 5 times an hour bc they are so good! have a nice day to whoever is reading and happy 4th of july!
"With all the features you get with this app is amazing. No watermark, except at the end which can be removed. There are so many amazing features that can be used for things such as youtube. Thanks for this amazing app."
My friend showed me this app when we were filming a video. I have always wanted to have a YouTube career and now I can!!! CapCut has the cutest images and gifs. It even has the subscribe button image. You can add music and it is so easy definitely recommend!!!!
it’s so hard f u
The first time I got this app I loved it.There are so many things you can do
It is absolutely amazing I love the app! I especially love how there isn’t ANY watermark! 900000/5!!!
"I love it,I can make yt video’s easily,edit easily,basically,it’s amazing. But,one time I pressed “create project” and it’s said my storage was full! So I went to clean some stuff up,first I deleted an app that was very big,still said it. So I went to settings and,well,it said it wasn’t full. I restarted my ipad,still.said.it. This was very annoying and still is. Some help please?"
"Few Suggestions…
So far for a few months I’ve been loving this app and my videos have been getting more popular every time I upload and people love it, I love it!
So far no problems with this app, but I do have a few suggestions for the app that would make more people download this app.

-Make it so we can fade out effects like so they just don’t cut off
Like the text animations but for the effects!
-Audio, just like Videoleap with the different selected audio effects.

Overall I love this app! 🔥

This app is amazing and great for editing videos.It has good filters and effects but it keeps telling me my storage is full and I tried deleting many files and drafts but it is no use 😐
This app has helped me so much I love it so much it’s helping my YouTube channel rise through the roof I can’t believe that I found this app I am so happy that this app is a thing I have no idea what I could do without it
I gave it 3 stars because sometimes when I can’t edit people say eww you use cap cut in 2020-2021 I’m like sorry I can’t help it so I went on to vsp.
This app is amazing.At first I only used this app called clips but since then I’ve been using this app.I’m a very bad writer so this may feel short or long tbh idk.I just want the creators to know their app is amazing.I hope many people find this and use it as well as give great reviews!
"So I’ve used this app for over a year to make my YouTube videos and I’ve got to admit it. This app is AMAZING! But there’s one thing about it that can be very annoying.. it takes awhile to load when you choose the picture/video you want in the video. So I would usually use a different app to make my video then use this app for affects, but for me this is a great app for affects!"
This app is super good for me I can make super cool edits on my YouTube and it is super easy to learn how to use it. Everyday I learn a new way to use it
"VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV
ok this app is uh yeah
Find the 😒
😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😒😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏
If you found it don’t download this app :)
That’s my review bye"
I’m happy with this app! I’m a gacha editor and I am so happy that this app is invented!I suggested cap cut to my cousin and she liked it.10/10!
This app is amazing I use it for all my videos in YouTube there’s nothing better there’s more video editors but this is my favorite it does get lot of storage....
"Please add:

Shakes

Qr codes 

A search bar to search for animations 

New stickers like [subscribe] [like] [comment] and more"
OMG I love this app like when you can’t edit from scratch this is the app to go to like for roblox I use this app a lot also go follow me in roblox my user is itsnamya8
I personally love this app.💜but I hope the slowmo could be a little more smother this is no hate.and the effects I love them and I love how it’s free
I would like to say that 1 thing should do is add more text fonts from the (dafont.com ) and like how alight motion feature text and I think it would change the game if it did that.
"It’s a good app, the bad reviews are from people who don’t know how to use it. (youtube vids for that) I would like to request the exploding text like after effects and I wish it would stop being laggy after adding text and overlays. Thanks for the app!"
"I cant with this app anymore-
I was trying to make a video for YouTube and I was importing photos for something that I needed and it just said “sorry didn’t work try again later” LIKE- WHAT-😀
EXCUSE ME
YOU
YES
YOU
CAPCUT
YOU
MADE
ME

OVER
300+
OF MY HARD WORKING PROJECTS THAT TOOK OVER 1360 HOURS TO DO FOR THE PAST 2 1/2 YEARS-.

IM SWITCHING BACK TO KINEMASTER!"
"why should you? bc it’s just plain old AMAZING! You don’t even know how many Roblox edits and edits in general I’ve made. I can’t even describe how badly I LOVE THIS FREAKING APP. You can remove the watermark in KineMaster you have to pay in CapCut it’s free. You get so many transitions, stickers, effects, and so much more! It’s easy to use and fun! You can extract audio from videos you’ve recorded. And if you have tiktok (I dont) you can extract audios you’ve saved. It works on phone and iPad and is really helpful for YouTubers. One of my favorite youtubers uses this app. It’s my favorite app the app that takes up all my battery. And my screen time. Its easy and fun and I love it so much, have I mentioned that I love this freaking app? Lol. Me and my best friend both love this app. I’m still a little confused about overlays, but I’ll get the hang of it. I had to get rid of a lot of apps to clear storage and now Roblox and like Netflix and YouTube and others are my only fun game apps now. But I still love CapCut. I’m telling you, CapCut is my FAVORITE FREAKING APP. To summarize it, CapCut is easy and fun. Useful and sweet. You can make lots of things and edits and stuff. I love this app. idk how many times I’ve said I love this app, but I LOVE THIS APP. I definitely recommend this app. Best editing app ever. I’ve grown in my edits. And this app is like SO FREAKING GOOD OMG. You NEED TO GET THIS APP. if your an editor, get this app. If your a tiktoker, get this app. if your a bored person who wants to do something productive but not like cleaning your room or bathroom, get this app. EVERYONE GET THIS APP. Thank you for reading. :)"
"Capcut is amazing. Don’t get me wrong, but it seems to be missing something. I’ve seen that some people on either a Google pixel or some other android device have the ability to make their own template and use it. iOS users on the other hand, do not have the ability to do this, and it would be really useful if we could, in my opinion. I am a small content creator on tiktok, and I would love to see this implementation for iOS."
It is amazing I can post YouTube or tik tok video+insta and that’s amazing I love it
"It has everything you need built in music stickers Crome key all for free!I think you should let people us the app even if they have bad storage and just download it later.Anyways I also think some tutorials would go really well cause my brother his skills are all right, not the best.Same with some of my friends to.That’s all bye!"
I raved about the captioning feature but it is no longer working. I updated the app and reinstalled but the captioning feature is still unavailable
SAME I LOVE IT
I don’t have a YouTube account yet but when I do I’ll sponsor you in my videos this is the best editing app I’ve used yet I just want to say one more thing the only problem is that I’m making an animated series with my gotcha characters and I really need to add  More overlays than you allow me to so can you do that it would be really helpful for my gotcha in my channel and that’s mostly the only problem I have but thank you for this app it’s amazing :)
This app is so good it really helps me with my YouTube videos and I love it download this app right now!!!!!
"THE BEST EDITING APP I HAVE EVER HAD!!!
I did not have any problems with it so far and it is very easy to use.3000% recommend."
"Like 1,2,3-4-5/6/7/8/9>>>>>>>10000000000"
I first when I downloaded this app I was confused how to use it with the help of YouTube it helped me a lot to do amazing and approval edits! 100% recommend❤️✨😃
"Hello this a good app totally recomendable if u just started editing, it’s easy to use and fun.but... there is still stuff it is missing it needs more voice effects because just have it high and low isint a lot,maybe a wavy type of effect kinda like in tic tok it also needs more effects for vids because sometimes I looking for something and I can’t find it maybe try adding a echo but if ur reading this try downloading it it’s good other then what I just said it’s a perfect app. Have a good day"

"Review:

I’ve been using CC for a couple of months now and between then and now I’ve greatly improved in my edits and I honestly appreciate the app for helping me get more experienced in getting creative. Edits can be so much more than just slapping a couple of pre-made transitions and calling it a day if you just experiment with your options a lot more.

I actually find it fun editing in CC rather than frustrating or exhausting. Sure, it may take an hour, an entire day or an entire night to get it done but it’s definitely worth it if you enjoy it.

The mechanics are easy to understand and most of the time things don’t get messy (such as undoing a keyframe and having the clip zoomed in, or adjusting the masking and having it stuck in at a certain limit, or editing an overlay with a splice added and having the outside completely black.)

Those were just some nitpicks. Oh, and a major issue to me is the lag depending on how complex the edit is or how much overlays are included. Not only does the preview freeze, the audio glitches out real bad. I’m currently typing this out just right when I updated the app right when I began this review. So hopefully that issue might’ve been dealt with, or at least some of the others.

I don’t really have much to say, but it’s overall positivity about the app. Now, about the new template feature.

Template Feature:

I’m not sure as to why this is, but Android users seem to be the only people able to access the ability to create templates and view others while iOS users (such as myself) can only use templates from the Shortcut area. I’m hoping that at some point this feature will release for iPhone users, I think it’d be fun creating templates for others to use!

That’s just one possibility. Either it’s only actually available for Android users or the iPhone I’m using is too outdated to be able to create templates. Which I hope isn’t the case.

This is much more short, but it was the main reason why I wrote down this review. I just thought I should include my actual thoughts on the app entirely as well.

That’s all from me, thank you for reading and please excuse any grammatical errors (I always miss those)."
Alright so I used to use iMovie it really sucked but when I heard about capcut on tictok I had to get it capcut is making me obsessed so now I use capcut all the time and I rate capcut 1000000/4 don’t get me wrong it’s a good app so if you want to edit get capcut✨
This has really helped me with my YouTube channel and I read it a five star because it’s one of the best editing apps for mobile and it’s so fun enjoyable and it’s 100% free no buying stuff in the app no subscription and it’s the best app I’ve probably ever used for editing <3
This is great and very useful for TikTok videos.CapCut makes me go so viral.
This app is like heaven I love it! You need to get a 100000/10
"Hello! I just wanted to say you should DEFINITELY DOWNLOAD THIS APP! It’s really great for making edits, also you can make YouTube videos and intros on there! Also really great to improve you picture editing skills! It has sound effects, and you can make sound effects, But the reason why I take off a star is because it’s SUPER sensitive to storage, like I cleared 167 pictures from my camera roll and it stills says my storage is full which I VERY frustrating, is there a chance you guys can fix that? Anyways it’s pretty good app besides that issue, I for sure recommend downloading. 🙂"
The developers constantly shoving this app’s ads in my face pretty much sums up why I can’t be bothered to use their content.
I’ve recorded a lot of Audio from YouTube and it usually works out but sometimes it doesn’t I would like to know why this happens.
I got over 1000 views doing CapCut edits on YouTube and when I first started I was a beginner and I used CapCut now tons of people ask me to do edits for them. So it’s an amazing app to use for beginners or advanced
The app is pretty dope but when I tried to edit it keep saying I didn’t have enough space and then I deleted like 200-300 things and it still said it.
I’d like to request if you could allow Spotify music in here to there are a lot of songs I have that are part of gacha memes so please get this request thank love the app ❤️
I love this app it’s amazing for my edits like roblox and gacha life!It helps out so much!!But whenever I’m not making a gacha life edit when I am making a gacha episode or movie it’s bad for it why?Because I need to add layers of stuff but because the limit it’s so hard to do it and it’s challenging.But overall the app is great I’ve had great experiences with it
"Guys don’t use this app it’s a waste of time! I recommend this app for only people who use tik tok not YouTube though! I don’t recommend it for YouTube for only 2 reasons! It’s lags and scenes. it lags by sometimes not showing you can put the text and overlay stuff and adding scenes it just layers instead which is very annoying! I don’t know if some of you got my problem but I think you should use KineMaster! It better and doesn’t lag and do all bad stuff like KineMaster and other apps! 😡😡😡😡
Fix the app and I will give it a 2
Btw this use to be my fave editing app but it isn’t because of all of these reasons. So ya don’t install it or download it"
It’s a great app! I love doing anime edits and posting them on YouTube. But most of the time they don’t turn out great. I don’t know if it’s because I don’t use all the tools it has or it just needs more. I wish they had more animations too. Overall it’s a good app.
"I absolutely love this app! I use it to make skits and videos and even my own TikTok's! This app made me love editing! Anyways, as I was editing a video earlier today, I was thinking “I wish this app had a heart button so you can heart your favorite videos! Also, it would be cool to add a “Public” video. Basically meaning that once you've made a video, you can choose to make it visible to other people on CapCut! Also, along with the visible idea, you can make it like YouTube and TikTok where you can like other peoples videos and subscribe or follow people! That would be a great addition! You can also add something like a chat button to give your thoughts and stuff like that. Anyways, back to what I like about this app. For me, this is like my own YouTube channel. Im not allowed to have a real one, but this app makes me feel like I do! It has pre made stickers that you can insert, it has text features and even voice effects! I used to edit with iMovie, and I really loved it until one day I was scrolling on YouTube, and i pressed on this video. I looked at their description and I saw that they used this app! I decided to download and once it was installed, I spent two hours testing out the features and editing. I have made over 70 videos within a span of two months! And the best part about it is that it is all free! No subscription, no money, nothing! And no ads! I would definitely recommend this app for people who are small YouTubers or editors. This app really makes my day. Shoutout to all the CapCut developers for making this app one that I will keep forever! Can’t wait to see what updates will come in the future!"
This is the best and easy editing app to use the edits I do make me proud of all the great hard work I did this app is amazing my favorite part Is when I add the music and I had an idea if you could PLEASE add any type of music like if I wanted Taylor Swift music I type it up and it’s their so please add that anyway so this is an amazing app so please Please add the update I wanted am begging cause it’s getting really annoying that I have to go on YouTube and screen record the hole song and I just get bored so please add that update sometimes the music video is long and it might even take 1 Hour!!
I recently made a YouTube channel and use this to make Harry Potter edits and I already have 1k. This app is awesome and I really recommended it!
Well I would say that I love CapCut be I can’t even get into the app.But have a wonderful day

Everything is good the effects and everything i love the chroma key this app really helps me with my YouTube videos for editing them this app is insane 5 star review from me i cannot believe how awesome this app is
"I absolutely LOVE this app. It is super helpful for TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, etc. There is a HUGE variety and so much to choose! There are many styles of videos you can make and it is super open to use! It’s not too hard either, it’s super easy to navigate and it’s really fun to use. One thing I wish they would improve are their fonts. The fonts in their text just aren’t enough or the style I’m looking for. I wish you could download your own fonts into the app. And make it more YOUR style instead of using green screens and stuff. Other than that I 100% recommended this app. It’s truly works dreams."
when are we gonna have the same features as android capcut? i’ve seen there is a lot of features that has not yet been implemented in the ios version of capcut..
"I love Capcut, I use it all the time.But here are a few suggestions:

•add ""apply all"" effect to text

•when i import the video it sometimes messes up the quality

•maybe a few more fonts

•more animations for the fonts

•specific cropping, like not just the borders but being able to erase things

•when using the slide in animation for text go one line at a time instead of the whole paragraph 

•add an option for text to fade in letter by letter"
I love using this app but there is one problem I can’t post to youtube that is one of the main reasons I got this app but I can’t do that
I redownloaded it and turned off my WiFi and everything.and powered off my device but it seems that when I go to animation or filters and stuff like that it keeps saying internet connection problem when my WiFi is full bars? And I can’t get it to work which is very stressful. And I like using this app but it just somehow started glitching.
I absolutely love this app. I edit all my YouTube videos and other just small edits on here. I definitely suggest this app for beginner YouTubers like myself or someone who just wants to edit videos. If you don’t know how to work something YouTube has been many tutorials on how to easily fix that problem you don’t know of. This is my all-time favorite app other than social media because it all free. I hate how other apps make you pay for certain things or you have a limit of something. This doesn’t and I am super glad.
This app is a really good mobile editing software I use to edit my videos for my YouTube channel and the transitions are smooth the effects and best of all there is no watermark and you can delete the ending frame at the end this app has many more features but I suggest you download this app is you like to edit thank you you app developers for making this app😝🤙
i love capcut it’s helped me with my k*ceytron hate edits <3 go follow me on tiktok @idoxenon
"Okay so my review is only that why does it takes up to 3GB storage? The app size is just 107MB now I deleted it again downloaded it and then saw same thing! 
I just save my storage!
Now here’s my storage used and can use
USED 28.2GB 
CAN USE 224.48GB 
Ikr that why am I arguing with too lower storage used?
1 month ago I used 255.8GB STORAGE and also can use only 2MB 
But I also don’t want to delete this app
Cuz the normal font is really amazing 🥺
Btw please do not take more storage than 4GB 
Pleaseeeee....!"
This was a really good app best mobile one thats for free😺😋🙃😎 super good app. This is basically free adobe.And by the way relchef  you’re phone or iPad or whatever device you have its probs like an iPhone 5 try and get a better one maybe that will work and the it wont be so laggy.And Jeff you can fade it and you also can control how fast it is.And also i think that this app should come with instructions because i have no clue. How to use the chroma key but i saw it on YouTube and i dont know what the betouch is either some of the stuff are to hard to understand.I also think they should do updates just for fun.
"Hello,I really like using CapCut because it has a lot of effects and it’s free.But a lot of other apps have these color rays like Video Star,but I don’t know how to use Video Star so I use CapCut but I was wondering and hoping if you guys can add “color rays”like multiple color rays in the party slot Thank you!."
"Other that the amount of transitions , the app is great.What I suggest it mora transitions and effects and it would be kinda cool if you could add transitions when there’s only one video .Also, about the animation button I wish it wasn’t always in the beginning like it could be in the middle of the video.Anyways creator(s) I hope you see this."
"capcut is amazing. I make awesome edits to where it looks like it’s from after effects. It’s free, no watermark, AWESOME effects you can do such as intros for youtube vids or even making you edits reversed, adding text with animation, and countless more. Any song is free, WHICH IS CRAZY. you just have to screenrecord a song and save it to your camera roll and bam, you can use it. It doesn’t take too long to get the hang of it either, it’s just awesome."
At first I want say that  the developer of this app are so amazing.And it’s the best mobile video editing app.Thanks Developers❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
"It’s amazing five star but there’s a problem ...
Why when I adjust the photo and make it short
It does not take me to where the chroma key and animations mask and stuff like that when you put the effects it’s annoying please fix it I’m not hating but I would love it if you fixed it and it’s also hard to click on the short photo it shows you to flitter overall it’s a great app love it glad this app is available for iOS and android but fix the problem it’s okay if you don’t understand try to understand as much as possible you don’t have to understand it tho but perfect app thank you for your time❤️❤️"
This app is amazing I ♡ it I used it for my YouTube channel it’s call hawks big sister I ♡ this app it’s worth it I just tried it today and I got it all by myself it’s very easy it’s worth it buy it now everyone!
"The app is great in general just depends on your editing skill.It’s great for beginners and very easy and explains how to do everything.Although it may kick you out in a middle of a project but that’s mainly because storage space and CapCut is great on letting you know.
But really besides that the app is great! It gives you tuns of stickers filters and more, also let’s you take Audio from your videos in your storage or cloud ( apple) .
In general I love this app and I’d change nothing"
"I just want to say, this is probably the best video editing app! No watermark, no video limit, cool transitions and effects. Only one thing that kinda bugs me. Whenever I export a video to 1080p and 60fps, on YouTube it says it is 48fps instead of 60. I’m not sure why that happens but that’s my only issue. Everything else is fine! Thank you for this amazing app."
"This app is amazing and I would suggest it for anyone looking for good content on social media apps such as YouTube and TikTok. I use this 24/7 and I’m so happy with the outcome of my videos. There is one thing I would recommend adding with the key frame. I would like there to be choices on how it moves kind of like cute cut. I’ve always wanted that app but my mother said no. It would make my day so much better if you added that. 

Thank you for reading this!!!❤️❤️"
I CANT EVEN EDIT.I was making a extra long video for yt.And when I went to edit it said I needed to FREAKING free up space!!!!Like I was so triggered🙄.
I literally love this app. I use it for a silly reason. I use this to edit my tiktoks and my YouTube videos. It helps sooo much. Do not listen to the bad comments. Get it NOW it’s a great app.
I have been struggling with editing apps.Until I found cap cut.
"Capcut is a really good editing app! You guys should try I, I really recommend you too. But there’s one thing I wanted to say, I believe that you guys should upgrade the app where there’s a search button.
 
Why I said this is because, it’s difficult for me and some others to find the right effect or what exactly they are looking for. I’m not saying that it’s just wasting peoples time. But I’m saying that it would be a quicker way for everyone, 

The filters are good, but I had this idea where for the “Blur” effect, I was thinking for some editors including me. Where we would want to edit something and have the background blurred out, that way it would be easier For most of us.and The “Chromic/Chromo” (forgot name) But I was thinking that it would have this effect where it can chromic the background outline.

But once again its a really good app I hope everyone else enjoys the app like I do, it would be an honor if you guys would take my idea( you don’t always have too) but I hope this would make you guys have more ideas when there a new updates!💗"
YOU😉CAN👁LEAD🤠THE💀WAYYYYY✋
"CapCut is the best editing app out there.It has all the tools you need to make the edit you want,it’s all free too!"
"THIS APP IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! NO WATER MARK, AND ITS NOT HARD TO USE!!!!!!😫😫😫😫😫😚😚😚😚😊😊😊😊💕😉😉😉😉😉💕💕💕🍡🍡💜💜💜💜🌸🌸🌸🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🍡🍡🍡🍡🍡🌈🌈🌈🍀🍀🍀☘️☘️😫🌷🌷🌺🌺🍪🍪🍕🍕🍕😚🍡😫💕💐💙☘️🗡💐💜😫💕🌷😉⚡️😉☺️😘☺️🧐😝😋🙃🧐😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝"
"This is an amaazzing editing app for beginners, especially if you make AMV's. Everything is free, and the effects are lovely. Theres a variety of choices and i even use it to edit youtube videos. I found this app because of the ""Sugar Crush"" trend, and it was an amazing editor. However I have a couple suggestions. The app runs smoothly and there's no bugs or anything, but i'd invest in adding animations to nearly anything. For example: effects. Adding effects without no ""fade in"" looks choppy. :) thanks

-Alfred"
"So I use this for my YouTube and eve since I started using CapCut I started getting better feedback. I just wish it was compatible for the original iPad (4th Gen) If you could make it compatible, that would be AWESOME!"
I love this app and I definitely recommend it I think it is better to make funny YouTube videos on it like you can change your voice and that’s really cool! Hey also have keyframes and I love that! I just think they should make a custom graph option to mma who ur edits even better! And Overall I love this app!
I love this app so much for my YouTube and my Fortntie montages! But there’s a laggy glitch it makes my videos really laggy. And I can’t put the effects. If I put the shakes in the montage it makes it lagger and if I put it on slow motion it makes it for laggy. Is there anyway to fix it..
"Today when I was I need a video for my YouTube channel, this app said that my iCloud has overflowed and it Will no longer let me use the app I am deleting this. 1 star 😐"
I love everything about the app the effects the velocity’s everything except the volume cap if Videoleap had all these features that CapCut does I would switch to Videoleap because Videoleap has a volume up to 500 I’m not switching to video leap because of the less features but if this had one last feature being such a volume cap higher then the current I would love this app ten times more plz it doesn’t even have to be 500 300 and I would give this a perfect 5 stars
"I love this app, it got me a bit successful on YouTube and Tik Tok. There’s overlaying and animations but there’s a few things that can be added but isn’t exactly necessary. When uploading the pictures, we have to click on them one by one instead of sliding it and picking it all at once (that might’ve not make sense), another that could be added is loop animations. Like the camera swinging but not switching to another picture. Hope this all makes sense"
It’s the best app I’ve ever used and it’s so good for everything when you send it to your friends and you will get the best rating on YouTube from it!
"I totally recommend capcut, the features are amazing and great quality and the best part is no watermark. I also love it for my YouTube videos I always edit and create my thumbnails on it, totally recommend my YouTube is: AdorblyOlivia 🦋"
"Capcut is amazing! It’s easy to use even though sometimes thing are hard to do! I personally think capcut is better than most other apps. I definitely prefer capcut more than video star or ae. Capcut is free. The app is free and everything you do on it is completely free! Yes, the transitions are pre-made, but that’s a good thing! You don’t have to waste so much time making the transition yourself. You can do overlays and effects. You can trim the clips. You can add free sounds from other videos. And you can do really cool key frames! You can also make transitions by using the key frames! You can do so much stuff and there’s a huge variety of versions of different things! The only problem about capcut is the ads. You’re making us look bad! You ARE the app itself and even we know how to use it better than you! Please make better ads! Love you 😘 

ps. One time I was editing a miraculous cat noir video and then I turned into cat noir 😰🥵😩😍"
I have been using capcut for more over a year now and I got to say this is by far one of the best free editing apps for mobile phones I will start with what I like/achieved so I like how there are a variety of effects transitions and more they aren’t bad at all there very decent and you could make a good edit with them I have been making edits from capcut and I have built a platform of over 8K followers with these edits so thanks and also I want to talk about some things that I think can be improved like first the quality the quality of videos aren’t that bad but it’s not The neatest so it would be nice to have a smoother edit then for transitions it would be nice to have more specific customization like if I wanted to do a spin I would like to rearrange the key frames and have more control also can you add more transitions like more creative ones but of course I would like to have more customization options so that’s it but basically the app is pretty good especially for new editors and I just ask if more customization also if any of you need help or tips you can find me here: @Mjngifxuff (tell me you need help with capcut) thankyou for Reading this! 💜
"Hi!So today at the morning and also yesterday i just found out a star 1 and star 2 filter and i liked so much i used to edit a lot of vids with it.But today after editing a vid it got deleted  and i cried about it bc i liked it a lot also i thinked if its was deleted just to my phone but it is to my best friends phone too.
So please can you add that effect back!"
Don’t get me wrong the bling is cool and all but most of them like Moonlight doesn’t work properly.But it cloud use some blinging.
"Bro this app is awesome and on top of that it’s FREEEE!! I know editing apps that cost money that are no where near this good and it’s free. I love this app. 5/5, good for editing videos and if you want to become and editor for YouTube videos or make quick edits this is perfect I already have like 7 edits and everyone likes it and ask me what I edit with."
I use it for my YouTube videos and it takes way to long to load it I try to put more then 6 video clips
"I love this app so much! I got this app because I have a tiktok account (@earth.activist) and when I wanna use a green screen to show images it doesn’t let me because it has to have a certain measurement to fit the screen, but i can do all that in CapCut. Adding the text is so much better too, it has sooooo many different effects for the text. Giving the text an animation, MANY different fonts to use, a bunch of different colors to use, and many more. I also love the transitions they put for each clip, they always fit the occasion of vid I wanna do. This app is amazing! 
-Martina 
Ps. Go follow @earth.activist on tiktok so YOU can be educated on our planet earth 🌍"
"this is absolutely the best editor app. it doesn’t lie, this is easy to use. the transitions are amazing, and it makes my animation memes 1000 times better. if you want to check out my animation memes, my yt channel is bubbly.pancakes"
JK LOVE ITTTTTTT
I love yall or your app so much it helps me make my videos for youtube and tell people about this app all the time its so good and underrated (GREAT APP👏🏽)
"I love CapCut, but i dont get why if my storage is full i can’t edit/make a project. If you reply can you please fix? My storage has been full forever and I don’t know what to do. I spent all this storage making youtube videos. And i dont have money to buy more storage. Thank You"
"Ok so it’s an amazing app.it only took me like 2 days to get the hang of it. The transitions,the effects,the stickers,the filters,etc. i have made so many videos with it and edits with it,I personally think it’s way easier than any other editing app.it’s amazing and I really recommend for editors,especially beginners. I don’t currently have a problem with it. Thanks for reading my review!❤️"
I use this app for tik tok edits and YouTube videos I absolutely love it! And it’s free!

This app is so amazing! I use it for all my TikTok @angelic._.roblox3. I love the effects but I would love more animations
"i love this app so much, i use it for multi-layer things and for my wm! it’s helps so much, anyway, i feel like you should add this update: downloading fonts! like with video star and vont, you go to dafont.com and down the font you want, then add it to capcut!!! i’ve tried to do it before, but it didn’t work, ty and bye!"
I do roblox edits for YouTube. I love using this app because it’s so easy to understand and get the hang of!!
"Okay, Do there is so many things about the apps you can love. First of all, THERES NO WATERMARK!! Like omg- Secondly there’s a part at the end that you can just like take off. So it’s completely useful! No ads at all!! They have perfect fonts, and even have the wavy effect I’ve been wanted forever!! Irl who created this app but you saved my life. There’s also really great effects. There’s much more, but my hand is hurting. Totally recommend this app! :D"

"This is amazing no water mark and your bit charging 1,000$ for some effects this app is amazing 10000/10"
"At first I could not find ANYTHING but when you get used to it it’s great! I mean- you can do layers, text, audio, transactions, etc. if you are looking for a app to edit YouTube videos, or photos this is the app for you! I’m sorry for the short review but this app is amazing!"

Ayo this app go hard I’ve been looking for one to start my YouTube channel 10/10 would recommend
"This is very amazing. I can do any intros for my fans on youtube!
You know what? I should say...this is AMAZING, GOOD, I’m in love with this app. I don’t like Any apps like, KineMaster, I don’t know any apps like that. And I should say roblox, Phonto, and CapCut IS THE BEST. I’m freaking in love with this app!!!!!!! Love it. Keep up the amazing fabulous nice work. But, I wanted to test my gacha life characters and put it on CapCut and put it on a pink or any background and I remove my gacha life characters background, it turns black...So can you fix it?? Thank you. Love this app."
I really like this app and I think it’s very easy to use and it has good quality but I wish there was a way to be able to just search up an effect or filter.otherwise I love this app and that’s why I give it 5 stars
"i’m a very small content creator who likes to make small minecraft videos but i needed a good video editor with no watermark. I saw this app from an ad on youtube so i downloaded it and loved it. It had everything i needed for a good quality video, all for free."
I absolutely love Caput except there  is one thing that i would like them to add.When you  want to add a text there are hood fonts to choose from but i would really like it if they added more-fonts.Also when you add a picture and press animation the Combo Animations Mwah mwah i love all the options for Animations but could you add all those animations for texts please.But besides that i love it I would recommend it for Roblox editors.Thats all i got to say about capcut and overall I-give it   a 5/5 stars.
MY TIKTOK IS @t1redb0dy FOLLOW ME AND TELL ME IF YOU SAW THIS LOVE YOU 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😐😐😕😑😕🤭😕🤭🙁🤭🤭🙁🙁🤗🙁😱😩😱😩
Amazing to use for Roblox edits and channel I love everything and even better.. NO BUGS my respect for is 100000 you did good work!
"This app is so easy to use and it’s so fun I thought I had to waste some money but turns out it’s for free I love using it because I can make Gacha Life Mini Movies and a lot more fun stuff I even teached my cousin how to use it you can watch some tutorials on YouTube I’m getting pretty good at it now I can edit my vlogs (I don’t have a YouTube channel so don’t ask) and a lot more fun videos to show my friends and family I rate this more then 1 million stars who ever created this masterpiece is a winner of this app I love this app so much it’s not like kine master tho it’s much easier to make I’ll show my mom how to use this masterpiece too a lot of fonts and gifs and stickers a lot more amazing stuff in this app 😊😁✨ ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🍪🍪🍪🍪 I love this app so much!  Download this app and leave a 👍 in this review if you love anime and Gacha Life! 

                                                                                      -Ray Darling ✨"
"this app is really good! it has all the things editors need. the only reason why i rated this 4 stars is because i wish the app gave you tutorials. i know there are tutorials on tiktok and youtube and stuff like that, but i wish the actual APP gave you tutorials. like video star, but overall, great app✨"
"This app is overall great but one thing I would love you to fix is the laggy ness.Once I’m done editing a video, and export it, it ends up coming out laggy and slow and not at all like how the video speed was, I didn’t lower the speed on the speed button but that’s just something that’s happens to me and would love you to fix that bug, but overall great app because it  has many useful tools for editing videos."
This app is awesome and free love editing my Tiktoks and YouTube videos straight from my phone
Amazing app especially if it’s all free it’s really simple to use I love this app so much but when it comes to volume and effects it gets a little bit weird. Editing the volume doesn’t go along way and fading the volume is kinda complicated fading doesn’t  do a hole lot and really just doesn’t do the job.Doing effects is really cool but I would like if you could control the speed! Besides that overall is a really good app!If you can get past this I definitely think you should get this!
Amazing
"I love this app it works very well when I make my YouTube videos but sometimes it says I’ll have to much space when I don’t,I had to almost delete ALL MY PHOTOS and I didn’t like that after that I stoped using the app.Also it took was way to much space in my phone to so that was the problem so download if you want it’s your choice I hope this help you decide"
I love this app. It’s so easy to use! I use it for my TIk toks (twice.exe is the user) and they come out to beautiful. But I noticed that after using it I couldn’t put gifs in there anymore. They wouldn’t animate like they used to. I deleted the app and downloaded it again and it still didn’t work. Is that an update or is it storage?
this app is literally the best. EVERYTHING is free! there is no adds! there is no scam! or cheesy filters everything is amazing! well done creators 👍🏽 👏🏽👏🏽👍🏽
"This is the best editor I have ever used. My small channel took off and because my this editor was so easy to use. This editor helped me with removing the black bars from my YouTube vids and is very good with memes. I am impressed you people but the extracting music thingy and very good transitions. I can make montages for my YouTube, I can split my video instead of recording multiple times, no water mark (I used to use kinemaster and hated it because of the bad transitions and water mark. And pretty hard use if I say so. So this app has basically everything I need.) And also, I wish your app could get more populist because of how big brain you are and how this editor is like no editor I’ve seen. But there is one liiiiiiiiitle problem. The app space is a little to much for people dealing with 16 gigs of storage so can you make alittle shorter. Well it’s ok this app is fine about how amazing it is and great for small content creators. Well I hope this editing app gets more popular like inshot and I will review more soon :)<3"
"I FRICKIN LOVE THIS APP 
There are NO watermark whats so ever, everything is free, it’s a great app to edit videos, make edits, and it has really cool features!!! It has everything I’ve been looking for, in order for me to make a YouTube channel.. And I LOVE USING THIS APP FOR EDITING I mean why pay for an app just for editing when you can use an amazing app that is FREE such as CapCut.. I love this app it’s AMAZING! 10/10 would recommend! And if your reading this because your not sure on downloading this app.. just DOWNLOAD IT CAUSE SIS/BRO I AM TELLING YOU THIS IS AN AMAZING APP 🤍🤍🤍🤍"
Ok so i got this app when i was watching a really good YouTube video and in description it showed the apps they used and one of them was capcut so i was like hey ill try it. So when i first downloaded it i looked at all the effects all the stickers and what can you do with it. And it was so amazing! Its way better than kine master or cute cut or any other video editing app in my opinion. One of the things i really like is that you can add layer over layer in the effects and keep doing it. Another thing that surprised me is that everything is literally free! I think this app is awesome and should be downloaded by so many other people! :D
This app is amazing I rate it a 1000/10 it is best for edits I'm not a gacha tuber but when u use this app it doesn't have a logo or anything 100% FREE probably the best app I had ever used ✨
"I’ve tried this app because I was looking for good editing apps for YouTube and I came across to this, immediately I was in shock. The functions and affects they offered were pretty good for a free app. I no longer do YouTube but I still use this app to make edits or to edit my POV’s on TikTok. I absolutely love this app so much and I’m constantly recommending it. The filter and affects they have are all free and super easy to use. They also have other functions to fit things in frame or add overlays. Overall recommend this app if you are looking for something to edit with if you don’t want to use videostar or if you are considering looking for editing apps for youtube/TikTok or whatever the case is. :)"
Amazing app follow me on tt anonymousofficiaifp
"This app is easily the best video app I’ve used and it’s not as laggy compared to Alight Motion and stuff. There’s a lot of transitions and effects that are all free and I greatly appreciate that. It has keyframes as well, which would be great and a bit better if they had the graphs to edit the speed and everything. Please PLEASE add graphs. It might look hard and a bit intimidating for people who don’t know how to use them but it’s really simple and you can look up tutorials on YouTube. That’s all I’m asking for is graphs for the keyframes! Thank you!! I praise those who made this app. 💙"
"This video editor is amazing, and I use it for YT videos. Amazing!
No watermark, every things amazing!"
"This is by far the best video/photo editor app I’ve ever downloaded, it has almost all of the features that a pc editor has and it’s 1080p quality, so it is perfect for high quality and slick edited YouTube videos!"
I rate this app 1000-10
I made some pretty nice videos with cap cut but when I put the videos to a shorter duration the pictures tend to not update as fast.Leading to my edits going off sync
"I downloaded this app because I saw it on YouTube. When I first got it, I didn’t really get how to edit. But it’s been only a week, and I’m already a huge step across! I absolutely love this app and the updates that have been happening. Thank you for making such a wonderful app for me to edit on!"
"Don’t get me wrong, this app is AMAZING 🤩 I use it to edit clips of celebrities/tiktokers... and it has been a pleasure and no-stress taking app. This app got me to do my own YouTube channel. What I have noticed using it to edit long videos, it gets laggy. Like ALOT. It takes 5 seconds just to split something. I’ve tried to make it to only 16 minutes... but it’s still laggy. I love this app very much. Before the update to have access to all videos/photos it wouldn’t let me add a photo and if I did in the “edit” area when I would try to choose a new one and it wouldn’t show up. Over all this app it great! I love it so much! But this app is definitely NOT for long videos 😭 but anyways, I hope you take this into consideration, have a good day 😊"
I give this a 10/10!!! This an amazing app for editing. You can edit anything with this app and there are no water marks and it is freeeeee!! I love this app. It is not hard to edit on and the walkthrough it so helpful for when you join! Over lays and Labeling is so easy to do and it looks great with bling effect or stickers! I LOVE THIS APP!! If you are thinking of getting it get it! I love editing on it and it is just a game changer! Download it and enjoy!
i have recently been using this app for all my edits and i LOVE it! it’s been really really easy to make a edit. i rate this app a 100000/5 because it’s so easy to edit with and i absolutely LOVE THIS APP! ❤️❤️✨
I just really love this app is the best app are used to edit for my TickTock sentence because I added anime things on TickTock‘s and it’s a really good app and it’s for free for free no ads at all there’s no as is for free I never had a app that’s for free that you can use even you can delete the end  know as there’s nothing that says cup cut. And I as always go to p effect that are really easy to useAnd it’s just like the easiest Abi ever for editing to use I just got it yesterday and it was the best I have ever I love this app so much and if you’re not if you didn’t download yeah you really should download it because it’s a really good editing app that you can use for your edits for TickTock or at us for anything you want to do a YouTube or anything it has like really good on things you don’t it doesn’t take that long to do because it’s your news anything is really easy because cup cut  hasTutorials or you can find tutorials on YouTube or anything but it’s a really easy app to use so I really think you guys should use it but over layers are really easy on it you can do anything all you just need is the picture of the videos and the space but it’s a really good app there’s no at all there’s no waiting so if you didn’t download cup cut you should download because it’s a really awesome app and if you guys see this I hope you download it because it’s a awesome app and I just got it and it’s really easy for me to edit and is the best editing app ever so that’s why I rated five stars and I just love the app so much
"It’s a pretty good app and no extra charges for other stuff like effects but I have been having a problem with the app. The app isn’t “catching my wifi” I guess you can say. I can’t use transitions and can’t send feedback but everything else is working fine? (YouTube, this review lol) so is it cause of my wifi? I’m away from home and the wifi here isn’t the best nor is it as good as the wifi at my house. I don’t think it’s a wifi problem though because I’m pretty sure YouTube uses more data so is there a fix?"
"I enjoy capcut. It's free, and I can do stuff just like video star without paying for a pass. And it's the only app I have to make edits 🥲🥲 Anyways, I also want to talk about the bad things about capcut. 1. I don't know if anyone gets this but when I am in the editing process, the transitions that I make are perfectly lined up with the beat. But, when I save it, it goes way off beat. This only happened when I had the app for like 2 weeks then it started doing this. 2. The beat marker system. Though it would be hard considering this is an app for mobile use, when i'm trying to mark the beats of an audio and the audio has fast beats, it would delete the beat I made previously before the beat, making it harder. 3. Key frames. I really like the use of key frames, but I think it may can use a little upgrading. When I use a key frame without any transitions, it looks weird and a little robotic. I was expecting more of a flowy movement, but it was just robotic and stiff, you know? When I use it with a transition, it makes the transition look weirder. Like the transitions become more robotic and not as flowy. And, I think that key frames can also customize the transition being put onto the video. So let's say we use a key frame for the beginning of a video. And one at the end. We can use a little bar that can control the transition amount at the end of the key frame so it can be a little like what we want. 4. Animation Extension. I think it would be cool if we can make movements in images. Like a photo of someone and then the arm is moving. Or a photo of an anime character and we make their mouth move. I guess we can kind of do that, but we would need multiple apps too do that. Also, we can make the photos wavy after a transition between 2 photos. And then add like a bounce effect after that. And, we can distort the photos with the song. So for example, during a part of a song, we pull on someone's eye ball, and it distorts that in the direction of where you pull it. But it would be better if you had like a certain section for that.And finally 5. Custom Filters. When I mean custom filters, i'm talking about 2 things. One, how fast a certain filter goes. So let's say the Back Flash filter from the Party section. We can customize to make the back flash go faster than usual or slower than usual. And two, we can change the ""noise level"" (grainy photos).

I'm so sorry for the long review but I really hope that you can look over this :)) 🥰🥰"
"there's sometimes some glitches or lag, but overall, this app is amazing! it's super useful for high quality youtube videos, with professional edits, and even basic fan edits! this app helped me a lot with learning the basics of fan edits, and i've even been able to move to more complex apps like video star all thanks to this. i use this for my youtube videos still, and the overlays and texts are seriously so amazing. so much variety as well for texts, animations, and stickers. i love how incredibly easy this app is to use, and how literally EVERYTHING is free. not a single payment is included to do anything. being able to delete the outro at the end inside of the app itself is also great as well. totally recommend this app for all video editors; both beginners and even people who are experienced and are looking to make simple videos."
"Basically all your fav editing apps in 1. I was using 3 apps sometimes just to upload 1 TikTok video which was a little annoying. Now I can resize a video, add effects, captions and upload from the app. 100% recommend! @Yvonne.Mugure"
"I'm a youtuber right? Yeah, I use this app to edit my videos! Over All it's AMAZING, But I wish they could add a feature for when you export the edited video you can upload it to youtube right away! Just a thought!!

Also youtube channel is {Abbiegirl299}"
I love the app I use it everyday but today IT DELETED ALL MY SCREEN SHOTS THAT I NEEDED TO USE NOW I HAVE TO TALE THEM AGAIN
"Ok so first off I barley write reviews but this one I have to type 
The app is almost the best editing app on mobile and I love the fact that it is has no watermark unlike some apps kinemaster and others it has some flaws like languages like Arabic and others 
We need more language options I use this program like everyweek
Cus that’s my upload schedule on YouTube so me and others need 
Other languages in the text option to make better content on 
TikTok or YouTube so if someone of the devs of the app sees 
This please consider it and take it in a serious way we need this 
Thanks for reading this huge text 😅"
It’s so smooth and it’s free the help on this thing is crazy my new favorite app
"no keyfram uwu
fix yo app cuh"
it’s amazing! i canta describe how happy i am to finally find a app that’s perfect. and it’s free which makes it 100/100 i love this keep going!
"honestly I luv the app. It helps me with my edits and I can try my best while working on it, great effects but can you maybe add more transitions and how can I share my transitions with other people using this app.one more thing maybe u can add custom graphs to control the speed of the transitions or the animations please I would like it to help me match it on beat with edits I make thank you.❤️❤️

*i hope you read this please* 🥺"
"So my cousin told we to download this and I did. I posted a lot on tik tok with this app. After a few months it said a have to much storage,ye I deleted some apps and photos.it still said full storage, I deleted some photos. I let me do it. And I made the video, it said too much storage, and this is the part when I get mad.I deleted the photos and I went to screen record it instead of just processing it.I clicked on it THEN IT SAID STORAGE I DELETED THE PHOTOS I  HAVE TO START ALL OVER AGAIN,bonus: that just happend like I min ago.."
"Hello! This app is honestly GOLD. this app is easy to figure out, Cute Cut, is hard to figure out so is Power Director. this app is very easy to figure out. I use it for Gacha Life videos, such as Gacha life music videos.definitly recommend! Also, the preset music is AMAZING."
ok i don’t usually write reviews on anything but i had a problem with this app. someone suggested this app to me so i got it and i love it! it’s great! but for some reason it only lets me use it once and when i try to get back in it it’s completely frozen. it doesn’t let me do anything. i don’t know if that’s just a phone problem but i just wanted to send this to see if anyone else has had the same problem before and how to fix it.
"I love this app like I’m in love ima use it for my YouTube channel! 100 % FREE no watermark great it’s easy to use outgoing I’m still snooping around the app but it’s good for editing , YouTube videos 
,and making a edit for ur idol I’m in love love love but a tip is in stock videos I want them to add memes and for YouTube vlogs but so on its great and amazing so u HAVE to use it"
"This is helping me SO MUCH with my youtube channel videos, and the crazy thing being THIS IS ALL FREE?!? wow! it’s just so amazing and great for editing"
I haven’t used it yet but I already know it’s great!im following a YouTube tutorial of how to do the among us live wallpaper! Tysm for making this app!
"This is literally the best editing app ever. Think I’m crazy? Check it for yourself. Last time I saw everyone using kinemaster. It’s a great app, but I lot of people complain about the watermark. So do I, I try to find editing apps with as small watermarks as possible. Great thing that CapCut has an option to remove the watermark. This app helps me with all my YouTube videos and school projects. Awesome quality also! I would recommend this app to anyone, it’s amazing!"
"I’ve been using multiple apps to edit videos for years, and this app makes editing and transitions very easy and accessible and I super appreciate it! But I have just one suggestion that may really well round the app out! With transitions, sometimes they stop a bit abruptly when it gets to the end of the transition time, but there are things that could be implemented that could offer more for the people on the fence about which app to use! Something that could fix, or at least customize, how the transition ends could be if there was a transition curve added to the app! It doesn’t necessarily need to be the type that a person can specifically alter every aspect of the transition rate, but perhaps a dozen set curves to get people started! I great example of this kind of thing can be seen of CuteCut or CuteCutPro, when you make a transition and scroll to the right of the transition options, it gives set transition curves to smooth, bounce, or alter the curve of the transition, which makes them smoother most of the time! I’m not sure how much of a pain in the butt this would be to implement, but I wanted to mention it!"
You helped me so much this app is so ez and great for edits ILYSM love this app recommend it 147833839293839/10
Capcut is an amazing app!! I love I make all my edits here and it’s very simple to use!!! I just have a couple suggestions!! When I make projects it says I have no storage at all but I do.. it gets pretty annoying I have to constantly delete apps or just reinstall it.another suggestion is on video star  they have these “rainbow” effects maybe you could add something similar to that!? Thank you!!!☺️
"So im a 9 yr old and i rlly love to edit i was inspired by my brother  (he also do edits) and then one day he told me to make a youtube channel if u like so i have one now so before I downloaded so many editing apps and ALL of this them have a water mark and yeah but what i rlly recommend is that pls put more fonts but overall its 100% amazing so if somebody is looking at this review pls i if you want to edit ur vids download this app its so easy and thx for making this app it rlly amazing

           (P.S. pls put a beginner tutorial for new ones)
Alright bye now ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ"
"I’ve been using Capcut for my videos on Youtube for a few months (almost a year) now, and I think it’s really good. There aren’t any ads, it doesn’t constantly bother you to get a monthly trial, and there’s no watermark to get in the way of the video. But I have 4 problems with it. #1, it takes up A LOT of space on my device. #2, the videos are cropped in a strange way and I can’t change it. #3, the video turns out kind of blurry when I export it. You can still understand what’s going on, but less. and #4 there isn’t a dark mode. It’s very blinding especially when I’m editing at night. I’m giving this app 4 stars because aside from those things, it’s better than any other editing app I’ve ever used."
This app is amazing but one bug happened and it won’t let me press the effects button or the sticker as well.I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it but it still doesn’t work.can you please tell me why
I love this app 100%. I use it 24/7 with all the edits I make it works great. Non of my other editing apps are like this Because this has so many features to pick from to animation and to effects. This is a great app anybody that does not have it should try this app out because this app will be used ALOT if you have a tik tok or a YouTube channel that you do tutoriols on it will help ALOT to grow! So this app will be used a lot so that’s why I rate it full stars and no complaints. This app is so underrated all my friends think I’m so good at editing now!!!
I love this app but when you go to blur a video can you put a bar like how much you want it to blur if that makes sense.all together is a really nice app I use it for my videos and is really easy.
Shiiiii I love this app(mostly because it’s free)but ayy it slaps because most editing apps you got to pay for and even if you don’t have to the editing is trash if you don’t have the membership.But luckily I found capcut and now I don’t need to pay no membership yessir
"Ok, don't get me wrong, I love this app! it's very easy to use and get used to. I do have a suggestion though, maybe we could have some kind of flashing option for text, overlays ect. so you don't have to find an overlay flashing on instagram, youtube ect."
"This app was shown to me on a YouTube channel and I tried it and I love this app cause other apps I use to have were kinemaster I loved that app but I don’t like the title in your videos on the corner it bugs me to see that, But this app doesn’t! So I stopped using the other editing app and used this one."
This app was so easy to use and it has no watermark! I also love how it has so many sound affects and transitions.Unlike some apps it doesn’t make the video blurry and choppy when you add a lot of layers. Also it’s free! I would highly recommend (especially if you make edits)
"I've used this app for 3 months now and it's a wonder! I love this app, recently while I was editing, I couldn't import a video, I googled it, nothing, searched on YouTube, nothing, so what can I do?? I don't wanna give up on this app since it's my go-to editor but help"
"PEOPLE, HONESTLY. THIS IS THE BEST EDITING APP IVE EVER USED. ITS FREE AND EASY TO USE, I LOVE IT. IMO ITS EASY TO LEARN AB ALL THE EFFECTS AND ANIMATIONS, IVE HAD THIS FOR JUST TWO DAYS AND IVE GOTTEN SO FAR. WANT PROOF? TIK TOK: @sqr4hh YOULL SEE. THIS IS AN AMAZING APAPPAPSPWKJAKSKSK."
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🤍😄🤍😛
It’s a great app and very very useful for me to edit my videos for YouTube but when I try to use the effects it says internet connection but I’m connected to the internet but it won’t let me use the effects this has been going on for like 2 weeks now it’s kinda annoying is this a bug or is something with my internet may I get a response of this please
This is the best editing app i’ve ever had.I usually don’t make complex edits because i don’t know how but this makes it easy and the transitions are great.Tysm!!❤️
If I could give the creator 1000000$ I honestly would Bc it’s so free the other editing apps you have to pay like 8$ a month I love the greater!!!
"Are use this app for a lot of my YouTube videos and videos in general but then when I try to make a video that could be 10 minutes or more at the two minute mark it just stopped working it would never let me in so I start using iMovie to merge all of us together with the audio sounded terrible with all the different songs in the starts of them I have the developer Sees this and makes it where it doesn’t crash every single time a video is at least over 30 seconds for me I don’t know it’s going on I’ve deleted all my other videos that I’ve made on it and I might have to delete the app and re-download it sadly but I hope this gets fixed soon because I love this app and it’s help me out so much 
Also my channel is HadleyPlays If you wanna watch it"
I live this app cause it only shows it water mark at the end and I can put music for free and not get copyrighted!! Btw YouTube is kvyla sorry for self promo ;-;
"I swear thanks to this app I’ve learned so much! I reached 1k subscribers on YouTube thanks to this app! It has everything!

But I’ve been wanting a camera jitter down or up transition when you split 
It would make the app much more fun!"
"I had to understand a silent tutorial video which had no cursor.  “How to configure an Android Launcher’s animated transitions”?  Not a chance.  Every time a button was pushed, I needed to backup the video and insert notes before the button push.  I needed to know which buttons were being pushed, and when, and why.  But how?

I spent about five whole days seeking an app that would let me add text and pointers to an MP4.   When I found out what CapCut could do, I felt like Lawrence of Arabia coming out of the desert.  Not only could I add text, but I could spin, slide, fade, color, resize, mirror, stylize, animate, and I did not even check on the audio possibilities!  I also did not max out on file size or duration.  And check this out: I did not read any instructions.  Boom!  Game ball, son.

You need to realize how golden CapCut is.  I couldn’t believe how mercenary the rest of the video editing world is.  The sheer Gordon Gekko level of gratuitous greed is astonishing.  Almost everyone wants that download first!  No cost estimates, no package prices; just nonspecific subscriptions with hard time frames and cancellation warnings.  “Buy a year of something from us!  We’ll tell you what you bought AFTER you download and pay.”  But that’s NOT how CapCut treats you.

I clicked once to start with my video, and softly fell into a soothing cloud of  possibilities on a timeline.  After all I had seen, I was still skeptical.  But my project kept getting more flexible and accommodating, until I simply forgot to be cynical about the final product.  I was having a good time doing tedious work.

CapCut is like an Italian restaurant that gives you everything you want and more, and then tears up the check!  What?  That’s right, babe!!  CapCut wears a cape!  It’s a superhero with extra garlic bread!  Okay; maybe CapCut isn’t the best app out there.  But after five days and nights of searching and studying, when I found CapCut, I found more than I was looking for.  Many thanks to the CapCut crew!  My project came out a smooth success, and I have you to thank for it."
This app really helps me 100/100% I love this app it’s very helpful for people who need help on things it’s free and the overlays are great and this is such a good app but on video star I have to pay for a lot of things while this app removes watermarkes and other stuff  for free this app  is good for edits but I also use video star but  this app is WAY easier also could u pls add more other translations I’m not asking u to be like video star but I’d also be nice if u add more translations for people to use overall this app is a good app and it’s not really for computer it’s mainly for iPhone which is great but I also wish this app is also great for  other devices that don’t have iPhones or iPads :D
I love the app it’s great and is easy to use.But I don’t like it when you put music or something else in besides the actual video it gets quite. It’s annoying because then I have to go change the volume of all the clips. And it would also be helpful if when you change the volume it would say add to all clips so you don’t have to keep changing the volume to each and every clip. You could just change the volume on one clip and it does it all the clips but besides that I love the app great job 👏🏾
"This is the best editing app I’ve ever used!
But one thing I don’t like is when my YouTube videos could be 20 minutes long but I have to cut parts to be 15 minutes and k don’t like that :/ could you guys please fix this :)"
This app is amazing and I love the effects but recently it has been acting strange. It keeps telling me to connect to the internet but I already am. I was on YouTube a few minutes ago and it still says to connect to the internet. I can see the internet bars are there and they are full. This has never happened to any other apps so I think this is a problem with cap cut and not my internet.
this app is the best editing app that I have ever used in my life. I’m a YouTube or and I’m always looking for good apps to edit my videos with. I’m so glad that I came across this. It’s so good that I’m literally surprised that you don’t have to pay for not one feature in this app. It’s amazing and I would recommend it to anybody. There’s just so much possibilities that you can do with this app and it’s absolutely amazing
It’s not fair- it works perfectly for my friend but for me it says I have bad connection? NO I DONT UGH IM SO MAD if you worked I would have gave 5 stars but I guess u didn’t want it >:(
Its a good app i edit alot for tiktok and youtube so it looks great but sometimes when im trying to add a photo it will just but nothing there like a have 0 pictures and sometimes when im trying to get in the app it just kicks me out for no reason
"9/13/2020—
Effects won’t show and I can’t download any new effects because of “no internet connection” and a video got all the effects locked and I can’t fix prior effects... please fix this...

8/28/2020
First of all I love the variety of effects could be used, add the audio effects are useful as well. It is a very good versatility to the app and it’s definitely worth the download. Using animations is a game changer too.

I will add though...I wish that the effects could also be applied as a overlay, and have the opacity adjustable. 
Additionally, I would love it if users could bookmark/favorite certain effects into a folder to speed up editing time."
"I love this app it’s amazing and I love how I get to make my own edits, but, none of the stuff it loading for me at the moment while all my other stuff it working like YouTube and etc. it says I have no connection like with internet but I do since all my other stuff is working."
YAS👏🏻QWEEN👏🏻GET👏🏻INTO👏🏻IT
"It’s really easy to edit with and has really improved my editing skills, but my friends and I have been looking to start a YouTube channel, and this app only fits phones. If there was a way to make the screens for computers as well, that would make it way better!"
I have been using this app for a while and this is THE best editing app out there. I use it for editing my YouTube and other videos. And they keep adding new features. But I do ask if they could put like a fish eye feature or something like that. But even without that this is the best editing app out there.
I’ve been using CapCut since I saw a ad on Instagram . I’m going to be brief but I would like to know when exporting a video what’s e best frame rate to export because my videos looks like low quality on YouTube and that isn’t very good . Help ?!?
If your like me and aspire to make good YouTube content then this is the app. Although it’s like really good no watermark and completely free I want you guys to add a feature where you can select all clips and move it wherever you want easily because the problem I have right now is that I had forgot a clip to put in the beginning and now I already have every effect and text in its place so when I manually move all the clips it’s take even longer to sync everything back up again just to put in a 3 second clip just because you forgot. And so now your either gonna have to start all over or your going to just completely give up. I hope you read this honestly. This would really change my day if you did do this. So whoever reads this that’s from the cap cut team please forward this to the head of the company to make this possible or something so I can have fun again and not worry if I have enough clips😁thanks for reading and I usually don’t write reviews but this is one I needed to do so.
"I love the app personally cause it is useful when it comes too most type of media like say social platforms like YouTube or Instagram and can be used just to better improve personal videos. 
Also that Evan if sometimes it will crash your progress will be saved.

Suggestion:
I work on different types of videos and would love if you could add a “Blur In” and a “Blur Out” transition or animations cause it would fit well with the many other animations."
Ive been using this app when only 9 people had it now 910 people have it i use this too edit my YouTube videos and tik tok videos dont change this app its the bestty
This app is very great for video editing and making with effects but one problem is about the time amount max you get.The max is 15 mins but if I’m making a video longer than 15 mins and spent a lot of time editing it it won’t export so I kinda suggest making the time amount at least 2 hours or shorter that way we can have a longer video :)
I would recommend the app for personal videos but if you plan to do YouTube it isn’t clear if you could monetize  the videos and if you can’t I don’t see a purpose of the app. Tried to contact the company several times and nothing so I might uninstall.  PLEASE RESPOND!!!!
"This app is great and I use it often for montages.
I would rate it 5 stars if it had a separate tool to order the images and videos, because currently it is very tedious to move everything into the order I want. It would also be great if I was able to use my music from Spotify in my projects."
I have used this app for many different videos on my YouTube channel and it’s been great! One thing I have a problem with is that when I want to watch the video it gets all glitchy and impossible to watch. Other than that this is a great app!
This is the best app ever now I can post my YouTube videos without buying music five stars and it’s also free
This app is good I used it in my android before and now I have a iPhone and it is till good I love this app so much
"It never glitches once for me. I uploaded YouTube videos with it, it combines the videos together perfectly, you can add different sounds and change the volume do photos and videos. There is so many transitions and all of them for free. It might take some time to upload 20 minute videos but it’s worth it. You can also overlay things which can be very cool for short videos. I LOVE IT!"
"This is the best video freakin’ video fx editing app on the marketplace today hands down and it’s FREE! 

I can’t express in words how stoked I am to have discovered this app hiding among the heap of garbage masquerading as video effects editing applications that don’t give you 1/10 of the feature that come FREE with CapCut. 

Seriously, the sheer amount of features, options and functions included with this  app blows my mind and it’s ALL FREE! No bs paywalls for the good stuff. This app is also user friendly and the user interface is so intuitive that you can dive right into it and instantly get to creating some really neat stuff.  

 Did I mention that All is this comes FREE; Effects, frames, stickers, sound effects, music, canvas formatting, resolution up to 4k, color, contrast hue, saturation adjustment etc as well as the ability to import your own iTunes tracks and if that’s not enough you can even extract/rip audio tracks from other videos to get around the DRM issues with iTunes if you really need a song, you ca also record voiceovers, they have even included pitch shifting and audio speed controls. You get all of this without any bullsh*t subscription/service fees or predatory weekly, monthly or annual subscription fees. You get everything but the kitchen sink with CapCut. 

This is some seriously kick ass software developed by pros who know what videographers, film makers and artists want in their video editing applications. And to make this app even that much more appealing they even have free updates where they add new filters, features, sound effects, stickers, animations etc. you name it. 

Oh and if you’re a TikTok user they allow you to post direct to TikTok. 

I LOVE THIS APP! For examples of what it can do check out some of my procreate time lapse videos I’ve made using the app @ 13lack Mass on YouTube. 
Thanks to the devs at CapCut! I’m officially in love with you and this app!!!! Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!

"I’ve been looked bf for a great editing app for like ever.everytime I get one, there’s always a cache to it.Not this one folks, this one is literally perfect!I don’t even write reviews, but here I am, cause it’s THAT GOOD. Thank u for an AMAZING app!😁✌️"
I love capcut so much cause EVERYTHING is free and it’s just like editing with video star and works on Iphone and android it has everything a pro editor would use. some people even say ever since I started using Capcut my edits have been sooo GOOD and because of this app I got called talented!! I just wanna say Thank you to the creators of Capcut 10000/10 do recommend you won’t regret
I’m not a bot you can find my edit account @yeumiio on Instagram. This app is so easy and straightforward it takes a bit to figure things out but I love it with videostar you have to pay for certain effects but not with this everything is free with no watermarks I love it 🥺💕💕 definitely recommend ❤️❤️❤️
Honestly I have been looking for a free video editor for my YouTube channel and CapCut is just that. This app can seriously compete with big video editing franchises and the best part it is completely free to use.
"I can’t even put this app into words...it’s just that amazing so simply and well organized, I didn’t believe it at first but when I started using it I fell in love.All I have to say is thank to who ever created this app you are a genius.. anyway great app you guys should totally download it"
So I never wanted to start a YouTube channel but I found this app and I said yes this is the one!!!!i love it ❤️❤️❤️❤️
"Okay... listen Im not a person who leaves reviews on apps, I’m usually the person who goes to the most critical reviews cuz that’s where you get more info if the app really works or not and honestly...this app rocks. I edit videos and all the transitions and cool stuff are all free and there great:) the outcome of the videos are great.Plus you can insert your music ;) for free like if you wanted to extract a sound from your camera roll you can. 100% recommend this app 🤗"
Awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome
My New Go to app👌🏾
"I love this app and I use it for my YouTube videos! But, I wish I was able to record on the app. Other than that, it’s an awesome app and I recommend it for YouTubers!"
